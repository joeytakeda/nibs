               <br data-el="lb" />American union, with a posse at his heels. He			
               <br data-el="lb" />had secured a berth at O Bar O in a busy sea<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />son, when help was scarce and work heavy.			
               <br data-el="lb" />His big physique stood him in good stead			
               <br data-el="lb" />when it came to a matter of endurance, though			
               <br data-el="lb" />he was too heavy for swift riding, needed for			
               <br data-el="lb" />breaking horses or cutting out cattle. How<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ever, there was no man in the country could			
               <br data-el="lb" />beat him at lariat throwing and he was gen<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />erally esteemed a first-rate hand. His last

               <br data-el="lb" />looked the part he played. His favourite			
               <br data-el="lb" />boast was that he <span data-el="q">“could lick any son-of-a-gun			
                  <br data-el="lb" />in Alberta, just as I licked every son-of-a-gun

               <br data-el="lb" />one accepted his challenge, pugnaciously

            <div data-el="p">Even Bully Bill, himself somewhat of a

               <br data-el="lb" />domineering than his own. It was uncomfort<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />able to have the big bully around, but the fore<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />man had never quite screwed up the courage to</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />suggested. Easy-going and good-natured			
               <br data-el="lb" />Bully Bill had suffered Ho to remain all of			
               <br data-el="lb" />that summer, enduring meanwhile the fellow’s			
               <br data-el="lb" />arrogance and boasts and even threats of vio<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />lence to each and every hand upon the place.			
               <br data-el="lb" />He had wormed his way to the position of tem<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />porary assistant foreman, as Bully Bill had dis<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />covered that the men took orders from him as			
               <br data-el="lb" />meekly as from P. D. himself. This was up			
               <br data-el="lb" />to the time that Cheerio drifted into O Bar O.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Soon after that memorable day, another even			
               <br data-el="lb" />more important in the annals of O Bar O			
               <br data-el="lb" />dawned that not only elevated the Englishman			
               <br data-el="lb" />permanently from the woodpile and chores to			
               <br data-el="lb" />the proud position of first rider. but lost Ho			
               <br data-el="lb" />his prestige in the cattle country.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The row started in the cook-car. The first			
               <br data-el="lb" />prod in his side had been ignored by Cheerio,			
               <br data-el="lb" />who had continued to eat his meal in silence,			
               <br data-el="lb" />just as if a vicious punch from the thick elbow			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the man on his right had not touched him.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Holy Smoke winked broadly down the length			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the table. At the second prod, Cheerio</div>

            <div data-el="p">looked the man squarely in the eye and said			
               <br data-el="lb" />politely:</div>

            <div data-el="p">This brought a roar of laughter followed by			
               <br data-el="lb" />the third prod. There was a pause. He had			
               <br data-el="lb" />raised in the interval his bowl of hot soup in			
               <br data-el="lb" />his hands and was greedily and noisily swal<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />lowing, when a surprising dig in his own left			
               <br data-el="lb" />rib not only produced a painful effect but sent			
               <br data-el="lb" />the hot soup spluttering all over him. Up rose			
               <br data-el="lb" />the huge cowhand, while in the tense silence			
               <br data-el="lb" />that ensued all hands held their breath in			
               <br data-el="lb" />thrilled suspense. As Ho cleared his vision—			
               <br data-el="lb" />temporarily dimmed by the hot soup, Cheerio,			
               <br data-el="lb" />who had also risen in his seat, said quietly:</div>
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="q">“T d-don’t want to hurt you, you know,

            <div data-el="p">Holy Smoke snorted, hitched his trousers			
               <br data-el="lb" />up by the belt, and then in ominous silence he

               <br data-el="lb" />Holy Smoke was a poor loser. His defeat,			
               <br data-el="lb" />while it quenched in a measure his outward			
               <br data-el="lb" />show of bluster, left him nursing a grudge

               <br data-el="lb" />would some day be wiped out in a less con<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />spicuous manner and place. Not only had			
               <br data-el="lb" />his beating caused him to lose caste in the eyes
