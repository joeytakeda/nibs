               <br data-el="lb" />head gazing up the hill in a brown study of			
               <br data-el="lb" />rapture. The sight of that army sweeping in			
               <br data-el="lb" />from all directions over the hills and from the			
               <br data-el="lb" />woods, to meet in the lower pastures and auto<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />matically form in to that symmetrical file, fas<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cinated him beyond words. Even the riders,

               <br data-el="lb" />shirts and coats, the Indian beaded gauntlets			
               <br data-el="lb" />and the wide felt hats not wholly because they			
               <br data-el="lb" />are good to look at, but because of their sterl<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing qualities for utilitarian purposes. The			
               <br data-el="lb" />chaps are indispensable for the trail, the fur			
               <br data-el="lb" />ones for warmth and general protection and			
               <br data-el="lb" />the leather ones for the brush. The great			
               <br data-el="lb" />hats, which the Indians also use in Alberta,			
               <br data-el="lb" />serve the double purposes of protection from

               <br data-el="lb" />during a long ride. The hide shirts are both			
               <br data-el="lb" />wind and sun proof and the beadwork sewn			
               <br data-el="lb" />on with gut thread serve as excellent places			
               <br data-el="lb" />for the scratching of matches. Cheerio him<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />self had by now a full cowboy outfit, chaps,

               <br data-el="lb" />been dispatched into the bush on the east side			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the Ghost River to gather in forty-seven			
               <br data-el="lb" />strays that had taken refuge in the bog lands			
               <br data-el="lb" />and had drawn with them their young into this

               <br data-el="lb" />to draw his feet out of the stirrups and ride			
               <br data-el="lb" />cross-legged in his saddle. Sometimes he was			
               <br data-el="lb" />forced to dismount and lead his horse over			
               <br data-el="lb" />trails so narrow that the animal had balked			
               <br data-el="lb" />and hesitated to pass until led. Rattling a

               <br data-el="lb" />through the deep woods. This loudly-clank<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing contraption served to rouse and frighten			
               <br data-el="lb" />the hidden cattle out into the open, but several

               <br data-el="lb" />failed to afford sufficient protection. The			
               <br data-el="lb" />sleeves of his rough riding shirt were literally

               <br data-el="lb" />a tree, resisting all tugs and jerks to leave its			
               <br data-el="lb" />secure hold. Cheerio, inexpert with the lariat,			
               <br data-el="lb" />gave up all thought of rescuing the animal in			
               <br data-el="lb" />that way. Instead, his quick wits worked to			
               <br data-el="lb" />devise a more ingenious method of pulling the			
               <br data-el="lb" />heifer from the slough, where she would have			
               <br data-el="lb" />perished without help.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />hauled a quantity of these over to the slough,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and shoving and piling them in criss-cross sec<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tions, he made a sort of ford to within about			
               <br data-el="lb" />fifteen feet of the mired cow. His horse was			
               <br data-el="lb" />tied by its halter rope to a tree. With one end			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the lariat firmly attached to the pommel of			
               <br data-el="lb" />his saddle which had been cinched on to the

               <br data-el="lb" />mounted. Now began the hard part of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />work. His horse rode out a few feet and the			
               <br data-el="lb" />sudden pull upon the horns of the cow brought			
               <br data-el="lb" />her to her feet. She stumbled and swayed but			
               <br data-el="lb" />the rope held her up. A pause for rest for			
               <br data-el="lb" />horse and heifer, and then another and harder

               <br data-el="lb" />along by the stout lariat rope. She slid along

               <br data-el="lb" />In fact, if one reckoned success in the terms

               <br data-el="lb" />saved for O Bar O the considerable sum of			
               <br data-el="lb" />$1500, which was the value of the pure-bred			
               <br data-el="lb" />heifer rescued from the slough. Moreover,			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio had brought from the bush the full

               <br data-el="lb" />of the Rocky Mountains towered before them			
               <br data-el="lb" />like adream. The glow of a late summer day			
               <br data-el="lb" />was tinting all of the horizon and rested in			
               <br data-el="lb" />slumberous splendour upon the widespreading
