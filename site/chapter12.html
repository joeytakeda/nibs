               <br data-el="lb" />unflattering and comprehensive sweep of a			
               <br data-el="lb" />pair of keen black eyes. Then, through the			
               <br data-el="lb" />corner of his mouth, he hailed young Sandy,			
               <br data-el="lb" />right on the job at the fire.</div>

            <div data-el="p">This was a job upon which Sandy doted.			
               <br data-el="lb" />From his baby years, fire had been both his			
               <br data-el="lb" />joy and his bane, for despite many threats and			
               <br data-el="lb" />whippings, the burning down of a costly barn			
               <br data-el="lb" />brought a drastic punishment that was to stick			
               <br data-el="lb" />hotly in the memory of even a boy who loved			
               <br data-el="lb" />fire as dearly as did Sandy. It caused him			
               <br data-el="lb" />forevermore to regard matches with respect			
               <br data-el="lb" />and an element of fear. P. D. had deliberately			
               <br data-el="lb" />burned the tips of his son’s fingers. Though			
               <br data-el="lb" />Sandy feared the fire, he still loved it. With			
               <br data-el="lb" />both care and craft, therefore, he poked the			
               <br data-el="lb" />fire, and pounded the huge pieces of coal till			
               <br data-el="lb" />they spluttered and burst into flames. The

               <br data-el="lb" />to be spared the branding. These, temporarily			
               <br data-el="lb" />driven to adjoining corrals, set up the most			
               <br data-el="lb" />deafening outcries and calls for their young,			
               <br data-el="lb" />while in the calf corrals these sturdy young

               <br data-el="lb" />the gate, he saw Hilda standing upon it. She			
               <br data-el="lb" />had climbed to the third rung and, hands hold<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing lightly to the top rail, she watched the			
               <br data-el="lb" />operations with professional curiosity. For a			
               <br data-el="lb" />moment, Cheerio suffered a pang of revolting</div>

            <div data-el="p">repugnance. That one so young and so lovely			
               <br data-el="lb" />should be thus callous to suffering seemed to			
               <br data-el="lb" />him an inexcusable blemish.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">It may be that Hilda sensed something of			
               <br data-el="lb" />his judgment of her, for there was a pro<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />nounced lifting of that dangerous young chin			
               <br data-el="lb" />and the free toss of the head so characteristic			
               <br data-el="lb" />of her wild nature, while her dark eyes shone			
               <br data-el="lb" />defiantly. Almost unconsciously, he found			
               <br data-el="lb" />himself excusing her. She had been born to			
               <br data-el="lb" />this life. Since her baby years she had been			
               <br data-el="lb" />freely among cattle and horses and men.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Daughter of a cattleman, Hilda knew that the			
               <br data-el="lb" />most painful of the operations, namely, the de<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />horning, was, in a measure, a merciful thing			
               <br data-el="lb" />for the cattle, who might otherwise gore each			
               <br data-el="lb" />other to death. The vaccination was but a pin			
               <br data-el="lb" />prick, an assurance against the deadly black<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />leg. As for the branding, it was not nearly as			
               <br data-el="lb" />painful as was generally supposed, and first			
               <br data-el="lb" />aid was immediately administered to relieve			
               <br data-el="lb" />the pang of the burning. It was the only			
               <br data-el="lb" />means the cattlemen had for the identification
