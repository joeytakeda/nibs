               <br data-el="lb" />but one thing. Chess! Sandy cast a swift			
               <br data-el="lb" />agonized glance about him, seeking an imme<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />diate mode of escape. He was slipping cat<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />footed and doubled over along the back of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />swinging couch on the verandah, when again			
               <br data-el="lb" />came the imperative summons, this time with

               <br data-el="lb" />of the customs that could not be ignored.			
               <br data-el="lb" />What is more, a man reported for his final

            <div data-el="p">It was also the law at O Bar O that such			
               <br data-el="lb" />discharges and reports should be made after			
               <br data-el="lb" />the working hours in the field. In the present			
               <br data-el="lb" />instance, Bully Bill had harkened to the ad<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />vice of his assistant and discharged Cheerio			
               <br data-el="lb" />at the noon hour. O Bar O, he contended,

               <br data-el="lb" />to work at the corrals, Bully Bill had come

            <div data-el="p">That Sandy summons was unmistakable.			
               <br data-el="lb" />The noble and ancient game was about to be

               <br data-el="lb" />interrupt when the game was in progress.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Bully Bill and the young McPhersons looked

               <br data-el="lb" />Rebellion bristled and stuck out of every inch			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the reluctant and disgusted boy. At that			
               <br data-el="lb" />moment Sandy loathed chess above everything			
               <br data-el="lb" />else on earth. It was a damfool game that			
               <br data-el="lb" />no other boy in the country was forced to			
               <br data-el="lb" />play. Sandy could not see why he should be			
               <br data-el="lb" />singled out as a special victim. Sullenly he			
               <br data-el="lb" />seated himself before the hated board. Blindly			
               <br data-el="lb" />he lifted and moved a black pawn forward			
               <br data-el="lb" />two paces. His father’s eyes snapped through

            <div data-el="p">Sandy coughed and replaced the pawn. His

               <br data-el="lb" />He slunk in fact along behind chairs and			
               <br data-el="lb" />tables, for well Viper knew he was on for<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />bidden and hostile territory. Reaching the

               <br data-el="lb" />before the big stone fireplace, Viper leaped			
               <br data-el="lb" />soundlessly aboard, and a moment later was			
               <br data-el="lb" />snuggled well down among the numerous sofa

               <br data-el="lb" />These dogs had been duly exhibited at the

               <br data-el="lb" />had so aroused the wrath of the indignant P. D.			
               <br data-el="lb" />that after a speech that became almost a classic			
               <br data-el="lb" />in its way, because of the variety and quality			
               <br data-el="lb" />of its extraordinary words, P. D. departed

               <br data-el="lb" />the time when P. D. would renew work upon

            <div data-el="p">Of all his possessions, Sandy valued Viper

               <br data-el="lb" />the ugly little yellow puppy, Sandy had loved

               <br data-el="lb" />in the beginning actually wrapping the puppy

               <br data-el="lb" />a baby bottle acquired at the trading-post			
               <br data-el="lb" />especially for that purpose. All that that dog			
               <br data-el="lb" />was or would be, he owed to Sandy McPher<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />son. Sandy considered him <span data-el="q">“a perfect gen<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tleman”</span> in many ways, one who could <span data-el="q">“put”</span></div>

               <br data-el="lb" />Viper could bark <span data-el="q">“Thank you”</span> for a bone as			
               <br data-el="lb" />intelligibly as if he had uttered the words; he			
               <br data-el="lb" />could wipe his mouth, blow his nose, suppress			
               <br data-el="lb" />a yawn with an uplifted paw, and weep feel<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ingly. He could dance a jig, turn somersaults,			
               <br data-el="lb" />balance a ball on his nose, and he could laugh			
               <br data-el="lb" />as realistically as a hyena. Not only was he

               <br data-el="lb" />had demonstrated his value by services to the
