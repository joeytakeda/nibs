            <div data-el="p">AUTUMN came late to Alberta that year,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and in the month of November, the cattle			
               <br data-el="lb" />were still upon the range. The experienced			
               <br data-el="lb" />cowman in Alberta is never deceived by the			
               <br data-el="lb" />long sun-laden days of however warm an Au<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tumn. Well he knows that the climate of			
               <br data-el="lb" />Alberta is like unto a temperamental woman			
               <br data-el="lb" />whose tantrums may burst forth into fury even

            <div data-el="p">It is no uncommon thing in Alberta for a			
               <br data-el="lb" />period of warm and balmy weather to be elec<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />trically broken by amazing storms and bliz<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />zards which spring into being out of a per<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fectly clear blue sky. Sometimes they last but			
               <br data-el="lb" />a few hours; sometimes they rage for a week,			
               <br data-el="lb" />during which period the effect is devastating			
               <br data-el="lb" />to such of the cattlemen who have their stock			
               <br data-el="lb" />still upon the range. The cattle caught un<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />awares in the Autumn blizzard upon the open

               <br data-el="lb" />body on body. Because, therefore, blizzards			
               <br data-el="lb" />are dangerous matters for the cattle to contend			
               <br data-el="lb" />with, it is the custom in Alberta to round up in

               <br data-el="lb" />the chief to set forth upon the Fall round-up;			
               <br data-el="lb" />to bring in the cattle loose on the winter range			
               <br data-el="lb" />to the home fields, where they would find			
               <br data-el="lb" />ample protection under the long cattle sheds,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and be given proper care and attention over

               <br data-el="lb" />from the summer range on the Indian or			
               <br data-el="lb" />Forest Reserve, en route to their winter homes			
               <br data-el="lb" />on the ranches. This steadily moving army			
               <br data-el="lb" />kept the O Bar O outfit on tenter-hooks.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />The harassed foreman was beside himself			
               <br data-el="lb" />with anxiety and uncertainty. The sight of

               <br data-el="lb" />yards aroused both his wrath and his grief.			
               <br data-el="lb" />He had worked his wits all through the month			
               <br data-el="lb" />of October to find sufficient work to keep his

               <br data-el="lb" />the Rocky Mountains. They knew the brands			
               <br data-el="lb" />of half the cattlemen in Alberta. They could			
               <br data-el="lb" />pick out O Bar O stock even when the brand

               <br data-el="lb" />could choose their own jobs and demand their
