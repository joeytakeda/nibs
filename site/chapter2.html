               <br data-el="lb" />and, with feminine intuition, she found the

            <div data-el="p">She was still mocking, but suddenly swung			
               <br data-el="lb" />the locket on its chain toward him.</div>

            <div data-el="p">She tossed it across to him. It dropped on			
               <br data-el="lb" />the stones between them. He stooped to pick			
               <br data-el="lb" />it up, and anxiously examined it, before turn<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing to look back at the girl with a slightly stern

            <div data-el="p">For some unaccountable reason, the girl’s			
               <br data-el="lb" />mood changed. She tossed her head, as the			
               <br data-el="lb" />colour flooded her face. Something wild and			
               <br data-el="lb" />free in that tossing suggested the motion of a			
               <br data-el="lb" />young thoroughbred colt. Affecting great			
               <br data-el="lb" />disdain, and as if looking down at him from a

               <br data-el="lb" />girl heartily joined. At the laughter, he
