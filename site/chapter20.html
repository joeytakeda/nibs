               <br data-el="lb" />upon those periodical occasions when remit<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tances from home were due, they came to town

               <br data-el="lb" />or several days of unadulterated spreeing.			
               <br data-el="lb" />They were not noted especially for their love			
               <br data-el="lb" />of work, though there was good stuff in most			
               <br data-el="lb" />of them as was proved when the war broke			
               <br data-el="lb" />out and a large percentage of the men who

            <div data-el="p">disposed to question whether this incident

               <br data-el="lb" />times intent upon acquiring a real interview

               <br data-el="lb" />contrary, had interviewed him. He was ex<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tremely interested, apparently, in newspaper			
               <br data-el="lb" />work, and asked the reporter many questions			
               <br data-el="lb" />concerning the sort of papers supported by the			
               <br data-el="lb" />City of Calgary, and also what opportunity

               <br data-el="lb" />was part of his trade, and he had discovered

               <br data-el="lb" />artist famous. There were people in Calgary

               <br data-el="lb" />the reporter understood, and he chuckled with			
               <br data-el="lb" />sympathy. He did not blame the man. He			
               <br data-el="lb" />had seen Hilda!</div>
