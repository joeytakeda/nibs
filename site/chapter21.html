            <h2 data-el="head">Chapter XXI</h2>
            
            <div data-el="p">Every night, after his dinner, P. D. would			
               <br data-el="lb" />take what he termed a <span data-el="q">“cat-nap”</span>.’ Not even			
               <br data-el="lb" />chess interrupted these short dozes on the com<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fortable couch by the pleasantly-crackling			
               <br data-el="lb" />logs heaped upon the big fireplace.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">There would be an interval, then, when			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio and Hilda would find themselves			
               <br data-el="lb" />practically alone in the living-room. Some<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />times Cheerio would look across expectantly			
               <br data-el="lb" />at Hilda, and she would turn away and stare			
               <br data-el="lb" />with seeming absorption out of the window.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Then he would bring forth his tobacco pouch,			
               <br data-el="lb" />fill and light his pipe and dip down in the			
               <br data-el="lb" />pocket of his old coat and bring up a book.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda’s absorption in the outside view would			
               <br data-el="lb" />undergo a swift change. Against her will, she			
               <br data-el="lb" />found herself watching him furtively. It fas<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cinated her to see the way in which he would			
               <br data-el="lb" />handle a book, his fingers seeming sensitively			
               <br data-el="lb" />to caress the pages. He always closed the</div>

            <div data-el="p">book reluctantly and would return it carefully			
               <br data-el="lb" />to his pocket as if it were something precious.			
               <br data-el="lb" />She had satisfied her curiosity as to the titles			
               <br data-el="lb" />and the authors of the books he read. She had			
               <br data-el="lb" />never heard the names before, and suffered a			
               <br data-el="lb" />pang that he should be close to matters con<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cerning which she was totally ignorant. She			
               <br data-el="lb" />tried to comfort and reassure herself. Even			
               <br data-el="lb" />if one had missed school and college, even if			
               <br data-el="lb" />one had been side-tracked all of her life on an			
               <br data-el="lb" />Alberta: ranch, even if a girl’s solitary asso<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ciates and friends, over all the days of her life,			
               <br data-el="lb" />had been merely the rough types peculiar to			
               <br data-el="lb" />the cattle country, Ae had said that a world			
               <br data-el="lb" />might be discovered right within the pages of			
               <br data-el="lb" />a book. There was hope, therefore, for the			
               <br data-el="lb" />unhappy Hilda.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">He had made that remark to no one in par<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ticular one night, as he gently closed the book			
               <br data-el="lb" />in his hand, and reached for the tobacco pouch			
               <br data-el="lb" />in his rough tweed pocket. Then he had filled			
               <br data-el="lb" />his pipe, beamed upon the sleeping P. D., and			
               <br data-el="lb" />with his brown head against the back of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />Morris chair, Cheerio had lapsed into what</div>

            <div data-el="p">seemed to be a brown study in which Hilda			
               <br data-el="lb" />and all the rest of the world appeared to dis<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />appear from his ken.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Cheerio had a trick of disappearing, as it			
               <br data-el="lb" />was, in this manner—disappearing, mentally.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Always there would then arise something tor<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />turing in the breast of Hilda McPherson. She			
               <br data-el="lb" />had a passionate curiosity to know where the			
               <br data-el="lb" />mind of the dreaming man had leaped in			
               <br data-el="lb" />thought. Across the water—Ah! there was no			
               <br data-el="lb" />doubt of that! Back in that England of his!			
               <br data-el="lb" />Figures rose about him. Hilda had an intui<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tive knowledge of the types of people who			
               <br data-el="lb" />were his familiars on the other side. Always			
               <br data-el="lb" />among them was the smiling woman, whose			
               <br data-el="lb" />hair was gold and whose lazy eyes had a lure			
               <br data-el="lb" />in them that to the downright and unsophisti<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cated Hilda spelled the last word in fascina<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tion. <span data-el="q">“Nanna”</span>! A foolish name for a lady,			
               <br data-el="lb" />thought the girl throbbingly, and yet a love			
               <br data-el="lb" />name. It was undoubtedly that.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">If the motherless girl could but have found			
               <br data-el="lb" />a confidante on whom to pour out all the tor<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />turing doubts and longings of these days,</div>

            <div data-el="p">something of her pain would have been surely			
               <br data-el="lb" />assuaged. Chaotic new emotions were war<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ring within her breast. Her wild young na<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ture found itself incapable of wrestling with			
               <br data-el="lb" />the exquisite impulses that despite her best			
               <br data-el="lb" />efforts she could not control. Hilda told her<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />self that she hated. An alarming voice seemed			
               <br data-el="lb" />to retort from the depths of her heart that that			
               <br data-el="lb" />was but another name for Love. This—Lovel			
               <br data-el="lb" />She could not—would not—dared not believe			
               <br data-el="lb" />it. And yet the simple motion of this man’s			
               <br data-el="lb" />strong white hand, the slight quizzical uplift			
               <br data-el="lb" />of his eyes had the power to cause her to hold			
               <br data-el="lb" />her breath suspended and send the blood rac<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing to her heart.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Hilda was not subtle enough to search her			
               <br data-el="lb" />soul or that of another. She could not diag<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />nose that which overwhelmed her. In a way			
               <br data-el="lb" />she was like one overtaken, trapped in a spell			
               <br data-el="lb" />from which there was no door through which			
               <br data-el="lb" />she might escape. She had reason for believ<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing him to be unworthy—a man who put to a
