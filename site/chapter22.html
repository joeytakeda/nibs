               <br data-el="lb" />merely laid the package of sketches before his

               <br data-el="lb" />were gazing across over an immense distance,			
               <br data-el="lb" />seeing probably hills yet higher than the one			
               <br data-el="lb" />on which she stood, with the clear blue skies			
               <br data-el="lb" />as her only background, held the attention of

               <br data-el="lb" />obit read like a romance. Son and heir of

            <div data-el="p">horse into Mallison’s arms a fine haunch of			
               <br data-el="lb" />venison. A man couldn’t buy venison from			
               <br data-el="lb" />the Indians, nor, at that time, could he shoot			
               <br data-el="lb" />deer. The Indians alone had that right, and			
               <br data-el="lb" />while they were not permitted to sell venison			
               <br data-el="lb" />to the white men, there was no law to prevent			
               <br data-el="lb" />them from making gifts of the desired meat.
