               <br data-el="lb" />that matchless chain of rugged peaks. Snow			
               <br data-el="lb" />crowned, rosy under the caress of the slowly			
               <br data-el="lb" />sinking sun, bathed in a mystic veil of gilded			
               <br data-el="lb" />splendour, the Canadian Rockies were printed			
               <br data-el="lb" />like an immense masterpiece across the west<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ern sky.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Hilda rode slowly along, her gaze pinned

               <br data-el="lb" />but vaguely. They were a familiar and well<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />loved presence that had been with them al<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ways. To them she had turned in all her girl<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ish troubles. To them she had whispered her

            <div data-el="p">As she rode on and on, her thoughts were

               <br data-el="lb" />her head slightly bent, Hilda gave herself up			
               <br data-el="lb" />to a long, aching, yet singularly glowing day			
               <br data-el="lb" />dream. Daisy made her own trail, idly loping			
               <br data-el="lb" />along above the canyon that skirted the Ghost			
               <br data-el="lb" />River, stopping now and then to nibble at the

            <div data-el="p">The woods were very still and lovely. Wide			
               <br data-el="lb" />searchlights of the remaining sunshine pierced			
               <br data-el="lb" />through the branches of the trees and flickered			
               <br data-el="lb" />in and out of the woods, playing in golden,

            <div data-el="p">Brown and gold, deeply red, burnt yellow,

               <br data-el="lb" />to the ground, moved by the soft fragrant			
               <br data-el="lb" />breeze and the branches on bush and tree			
               <br data-el="lb" />seemed lazily to shake themselves, as if suc<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cumbing unwillingly to the slumberous spell

               <br data-el="lb" />Scarlet and bright, all through the wooded

            <div data-el="p">Coveys of partridge and pheasants fluttered

               <br data-el="lb" />of Hilda’s mare, thrusting their noses against			
               <br data-el="lb" />hers, and laying their faces across her slender			
               <br data-el="lb" />back, utterly unafraid of the rider, yet timor<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ous and moving at Hilda’s slightest affection<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ate slap or word of reproval when they pressed

               <br data-el="lb" />an almost perpendicular slope, to come out

               <br data-el="lb" />of two or three miles. From this highest			
               <br data-el="lb" />point, the girl on horse paused to cast a long,

               <br data-el="lb" />and at last her long gaze was reluctantly with<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />drawn, dropped lower over the hill tops, the

               <br data-el="lb" />Nevertheless, Hilda knew that someone was

               <br data-el="lb" />Whoever was following her was keeping pur<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />posely under the shadow of the bush. Nor			
               <br data-el="lb" />could it be an Indian. Hilda knew the

            <div data-el="p">She pondered over the purpose of the man

               <br data-el="lb" />Why did he not come out into the open?			
               <br data-el="lb" />Thieves and rustlers would not have ventured			
               <br data-el="lb" />as near to the ranch house asthis. Their work

               <br data-el="lb" />with four wires, every field being laid out for			
               <br data-el="lb" />especial stock. In a country like Alberta,			
               <br data-el="lb" />where ranching is done on a large scale, stock

            <div data-el="p">antiquated barbed wire gates were kept tightly			
               <br data-el="lb" />closed. These were difficult to open. They			
               <br data-el="lb" />consisted of three or four strands of barbed			
               <br data-el="lb" />wire nailed to light willow fence posts at a

               <br data-el="lb" />clear from the ground and when closed			
               <br data-el="lb" />fastened by a loop of the wire to the stout post			
               <br data-el="lb" />at the end of the fencing. They were nasty			
               <br data-el="lb" />things to open, even for the toughened hands			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the cowboy. Hilda. seldom used these

            <div data-el="p">The days were getting shorter and already,

            <div data-el="p">Quite suddenly darkness fell. The trail,			
               <br data-el="lb" />however, was close to the gate and her horse			
               <br data-el="lb" />knew the way. Hilda did not dismount.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Leaning from her horse, she grasped the post			
               <br data-el="lb" />and tugged at the tightly wedged ring of wire.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Her first knowledge of the near presence of			
               <br data-el="lb" />the man who had followed her came when			
               <br data-el="lb" />something thudded down at her horse’s feet.			
               <br data-el="lb" />In the half light of the fading day Hilda saw			
               <br data-el="lb" />that uncoiled rope.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The lariat!</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Now she understood and a gasp of rage es<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />caped her. The man had attempted to rope			
               <br data-el="lb" />her. The lariat had fallen short! She, Hilda			
               <br data-el="lb" />McPherson, daughter of O Bar O, to be Iari<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ated like a head of stock!</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">As she watched the rope slowly being coiled

               <br data-el="lb" />presently it would be thrown again, and that			
               <br data-el="lb" />second throw might fall true. Instantly she

               <br data-el="lb" />tight knot, ducked under the wire of the fence,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and secure in the knowledge that her pursuer			
               <br data-el="lb" />would be held back by the closed gate, unless			
               <br data-el="lb" />he dismounted and took her own means of			
               <br data-el="lb" />passing through, Hilda ran like the wind			
               <br data-el="lb" />straight along the trail to O Bar O, shouting			
               <br data-el="lb" />in her clear, carrying young voice, the Indian			
               <br data-el="lb" />cry:</div>

            <div data-el="p">As she called, as she ran, an answering shout			
               <br data-el="lb" />came from the direction of the ranch, still			
               <br data-el="lb" />more than a mile away; but he who had an<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />swered her call for help was even then coming			
               <br data-el="lb" />over the crest of the last hill, and the silhouette			
               <br data-el="lb" />in the twilight of man and horse stopped the			
               <br data-el="lb" />girl short and sent her heart racing like a mad			
               <br data-el="lb" />thing in her breast. He was riding as only one			
               <br data-el="lb" />at O Bar O could ride. Reining up sharply			
               <br data-el="lb" />before Hilda, Cheerio swiftly dismounted and			
               <br data-el="lb" />was at her side.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />she was conscious of a strangely exultant pang			
               <br data-el="lb" />at the thought that he should have been the one
