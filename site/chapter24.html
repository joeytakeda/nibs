               <br data-el="lb" />the sheer ecstasy and glow of those first exalt<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing, electrical thrills. All she comprehended

               <br data-el="lb" />stiff with a new alarm. The unquiet demon			
               <br data-el="lb" />of Jealousy had struck its fangs deep into the			
               <br data-el="lb" />girl’s innermost heart. She no sooner tried to			
               <br data-el="lb" />recall his face as he had looked at her in the			
               <br data-el="lb" />moonlight, the warm clasp of his hand, the			
               <br data-el="lb" />term of endearment that had slipped from his			
               <br data-el="lb" />lips, when the knife was twisted again within			
               <br data-el="lb" />her, and she saw the lovely face of the other

               <br data-el="lb" />Love was now a purgatory. What was she to

               <br data-el="lb" />then when her pain became more than she			
               <br data-el="lb" />could bear, she turned desperately to her door.			
               <br data-el="lb" />At any cost, however humiliating to her pride,			
               <br data-el="lb" />she would learn the truth. She would go di<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />rectly to him. She would ask him point-blank			
               <br data-el="lb" />whether from this time on it was to be her or

            <div data-el="p">She had done without her dinner. She

               <br data-el="lb" />him. He needed a medium through which he			
               <br data-el="lb" />might speak to Hilda. On the back of an

               <br data-el="lb" />soberer thoughts. He was inspired by a de<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />sire to do something to prove himself worthy			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the girl he loved. He was overtaken with
