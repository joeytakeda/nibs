            <div data-el="p">As a boy, Cheerio’s inability swiftly to ex<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />plain or defend himself, had resulted in many			
               <br data-el="lb" />unjust punishments. He was not stupid, but			
               <br data-el="lb" />became easily confused, and with the best of			
               <br data-el="lb" />intentions, he bungled into unfortunate situa<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tions. His brother, Reggie, swift-witted and			
               <br data-el="lb" />glib of tongue, was far better equipped to de<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fend and care for himself than the often be<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />wildered and stammering Cheerio. He had			
               <br data-el="lb" />changed very little, and his love had made			
               <br data-el="lb" />him now almost obtusely blind.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">As he hurried eagerly across the verandah			
               <br data-el="lb" />to meet Hilda who was hastening in her direct

               <br data-el="lb" />mind demanded, Cheerio held out toward her			
               <br data-el="lb" />the intended gift.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">In the bright moonlight, Hilda saw the			
               <br data-el="lb" />locket in his hand, and she stopped short in

            <div data-el="p">choked, struck, and her heart was beating so			
               <br data-el="lb" />riotously that it hurt her physically. A primi<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tive surge of wild, ungovernable rage surged			
               <br data-el="lb" />up within her.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">In a far worse dilemma was the unfortu<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />nate and deluded and misunderstood Cheerio.			
               <br data-el="lb" />At that psychological moment, when he would			
               <br data-el="lb" />have given his life for eloquent speech in			
               <br data-el="lb" />which to tell the girl before him of his love,			
               <br data-el="lb" />he was overtaken with panic and confusion.			
               <br data-el="lb" />The hostile attitude of the girl reduced him to			
               <br data-el="lb" />a state of incoherent stuttering as he continued			
               <br data-el="lb" />foolishly to extend the locket.</div>

            <div data-el="p">Like a tidal wave, the girl’s anger over<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />whelmed her. Hell, which the proverb as<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />sures us, hath no fury like a woman scorned,			
               <br data-el="lb" />raged indeed in the ungoverned breast of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />girl of the ranching country. She was neither			
               <br data-el="lb" />equipped by nature or training with those			
               <br data-el="lb" />feminine defenses that might have shielded			
               <br data-el="lb" />her. She was in a way as uncivilized as the			
               <br data-el="lb" />savage woman who beats her untrue mate. All			
               <br data-el="lb" />she was fiercely conscious of was her raging			
               <br data-el="lb" />indignation at the imagined affront offered			
               <br data-el="lb" />her by Cheerio. He, who but a short time			
               <br data-el="lb" />since she had been deluded enough to believe			
               <br data-el="lb" />actually loved her was now flaunting before			
               <br data-el="lb" />her that hateful locket in which she knew was			
               <br data-el="lb" />the picture of the woman he had come to			
               <br data-el="lb" />Canada to make a home for.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Her eyes were aflame. Her anger domi<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />nated her entirely.</div>

            <div data-el="p">Her voice rose. She stamped her foot. Her			
               <br data-el="lb" />hands clinched. It would have relieved her			
               <br data-el="lb" />to hurt him physically. Surprised and de<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />jected, he turned away, but his movement			
               <br data-el="lb" />whetted her anger. Her fiery words pursued

            <div data-el="p">At that a light of understanding broke over
