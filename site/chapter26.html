               <br data-el="lb" />account books and other papers connected with			
               <br data-el="lb" />the running of his business. He was enjoying			
               <br data-el="lb" />a sweet sleep, in which he dreamed of three

               <br data-el="lb" />he stared straight at Hilda. Something in his			
               <br data-el="lb" />silence, some element of loneliness and help<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />lessness about this man clutched at the stormy

               <br data-el="lb" />her lips, as her father came into the room.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda had the strange feeling of a wild mother			
               <br data-el="lb" />at bay. Angry with her child, she yet was			
               <br data-el="lb" />ready to fight for and defend it. All uncon<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />sciously, she had covered her lips with her			
               <br data-el="lb" />hands to crush back the hot words that were			
               <br data-el="lb" />surging up to expose him to her father.</div>

            <div data-el="p">Hilda felt weak and curiously broken. She

               <br data-el="lb" />large that her face, no longer rosy, seemed now			
               <br data-el="lb" />peculiarly small and young.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Old P. D. scratched his chin and pinched			
               <br data-el="lb" />his lower lip as he examined the board through			
               <br data-el="lb" />his glasses. Cheerio was not looking at the			
               <br data-el="lb" />board, his sad, somewhat stern glance was			
               <br data-el="lb" />pinned upon Hilda.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">There was a pause, and suddenly P. D.’s			
               <br data-el="lb" />face jerked forward. A crafty twitch of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />left eyebrow. He glanced up at Cheerio,			
               <br data-el="lb" />moved a Bishop three paces to the right.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio withdrew his eyes reluctantly from			
               <br data-el="lb" />the drooping Hilda, looked absently at the			
               <br data-el="lb" />board and made the obvious move. Instantly			
               <br data-el="lb" />P. D.’s hand shot toward his Queen. A pause,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and then suddenly through the room, like the			
               <br data-el="lb" />pop of a gun, P. D.’s shout resounded :</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />gripped him by both hands, and shouted:</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />her father was all but embracing him, his			
               <br data-el="lb" />glance had gone straight into the eyes of Hilda,			
               <br data-el="lb" />pale as death and slowly arising.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />crouched down on the steps, her face in her			
               <br data-el="lb" />hands, overwhelmed by the unbearable pain
