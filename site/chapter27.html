            <h2 data-el="head">Chapter XXVII</h2>
            
            <div data-el="p">HILDA awoke with a sob. She sat up in bed,			
               <br data-el="lb" />pressing her hands to her eyes. Slowly, pain<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fully, she recalled the events of the previous			
               <br data-el="lb" />night.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">She had called him a cheat—a coward! She			
               <br data-el="lb" />had said that she never wished to see his face			
               <br data-el="lb" />again! She had driven him from O Bar O.			
               <br data-el="lb" />He had gone out of her life now forever.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Hilda could see the dim light of the ap<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />proaching dawn already tinting the wide east<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ern sky. It was a chill, raw morning. -He			
               <br data-el="lb" />would walk out from O Bar O, with his old,			
               <br data-el="lb" />battered grip in his hand and that gray suit			
               <br data-el="lb" />that had so edified the ranch hands. Her			
               <br data-el="lb" />breast rose and swelled. The tears of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />previous night threatened to overwhelm her			
               <br data-el="lb" />again. Hilda had literally cried practically			
               <br data-el="lb" />all of the night, and her hour’s sleep had come			
               <br data-el="lb" />only through sheer exhaustion.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The unhappy girl crept out of bed and knelt</div>
            
            <div data-el="fw" data-type="pageNum">[ 302 }</div>

            <div data-el="p">by the window, peering out in the first grey			
               <br data-el="lb" />gloom of the Autumn morning, toward the			
               <br data-el="lb" />bunkhouse. She fancied she saw something			
               <br data-el="lb" />moving in that direction, but the light was			
               <br data-el="lb" />dim, and she could not be sure.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">It was cold and damp as she knelt on the			
               <br data-el="lb" />floor. No matter. He would be cold and			
               <br data-el="lb" />chilled, too, and she had driven him from O			
               <br data-el="lb" />Bar O!</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">A light gleamed now in the dusk over at the			
               <br data-el="lb" />saddle rooms. A glance at her watch showed			
               <br data-el="lb" />it was not yet six o’clock. He would make an			
               <br data-el="lb" />early start, probably leaving before the men			
               <br data-el="lb" />started off on the round-up—they were to			
               <br data-el="lb" />leave for the range at seven that morning.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Without quite realizing what she was doing,			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda dressed swiftly. The cold water on her			
               <br data-el="lb" />tear-blistered face soothed and cooled it. She			
               <br data-el="lb" />wrapped a cape about herself, put on a knitted			
               <br data-el="lb" />tam.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The halls were dark, but she dared not turn			
               <br data-el="lb" />on the electric lights, lest she should awaken			
               <br data-el="lb" />Sandy or her father. Feeling her way along			
               <br data-el="lb" />the wall, she found the stairs, and clinging to</div>

            <div data-el="p">the bannister went quickly down. A moment			
               <br data-el="lb" />to seek the door knob, and swing the big door			
               <br data-el="lb" />open. At last she was out of the house.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The cold air smote:and revived her. It			
               <br data-el="lb" />gave her courage and strength.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The darkness was slowly lifting, and all			
               <br data-el="lb" />over the sky the silvery waves of morning were			
               <br data-el="lb" />now spreading. Hilda sped like a fawn across			
               <br data-el="lb" />the barn yard, through the corrals and directly			
               <br data-el="lb" />to the saddle room, from whence came the			
               <br data-el="lb" />light. The upper part of the door was open,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and Hilda pushed the lower part and stepped			
               <br data-el="lb" />inside.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">A man in white chaps was bending over a			
               <br data-el="lb" />saddle to which he was attaching a lariat rope.			
               <br data-el="lb" />As the lower door slammed shut behind Hilda,			
               <br data-el="lb" />he started like an overtaken thief, and jumped			
               <br data-el="lb" />around. Hilda saw his face. It was Holy			
               <br data-el="lb" />Smoke.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">All at once Hilda McPherson knew that			
               <br data-el="lb" />before her stood the man who had tried to			
               <br data-el="lb" />lariat her in the woods. She stared at him now			
               <br data-el="lb" />in a sort of fascinated horror. A cunning look			
               <br data-el="lb" />of surprised delight was creeping over the</div>
            
            <div data-el="fw" data-type="pageNum">[ 304 ]</div>

            <div data-el="p">man’s face. Hilda put her hand behind her			
               <br data-el="lb" />and backed for the door. At the same time,			
               <br data-el="lb" />once again she raised her voice, and sent forth			
               <br data-el="lb" />that loud cry of alarm:</div>
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="q">“Hi-yi-yi-yi-yl-yi-yi-itiii-i-i-i-i!l”</span></div>
            
            <div data-el="p">The cry was choked midway. She was held			
               <br data-el="lb" />in a strangling hold, the big hand of the cow<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />puncher gripped upon her throat.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="q">“There'll be none of the Hi-yi-ing for you			
                  <br data-el="lb" />to-day! If you make another peep, I’ll choke			
                  <br data-el="lb" />you to death! I’m quittin’ O Bar O for good			
                  <br data-el="lb" />and all to-day, but before I go you and me has

            <div data-el="p">She fought desperately, with all her splen<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />did young strength, scratching, kicking, biting,			
               <br data-el="lb" />beating with her fists like a wild thing at bay,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and, with the first release as he staggered back,			
               <br data-el="lb" />when her sharp teeth dug into his hands, again			
               <br data-el="lb" />she raised her voice; but this time her cry was			
               <br data-el="lb" />stopped by the brutal blow of the man’s fist.			
               <br data-el="lb" />She clutched at the wall behind her. The			
               <br data-el="lb" />earth seemed to rock and sway and for the first			
               <br data-el="lb" />time in all her healthy young life, Hilda Mc<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />Pherson fainted.</div>

            <div data-el="p">She lay on a sheepskin, a man’s coat beneath			
               <br data-el="lb" />her head. Chum Lee knelt beside her, cup in			
               <br data-el="lb" />hand. She swallowed with difficulty, for her			
               <br data-el="lb" />throat pained her and she still felt the grip of			
               <br data-el="lb" />those terrible fingers. Hilda moaned and			
               <br data-el="lb" />moved her head from side to side. The			
               <br data-el="lb" />Chinaman said cheerfully:</div>
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="q">“All lightee now, Miss Hilda. Chum Lee

            <div data-el="p">Hilda understood only that Holy Smoke

            <div data-el="p">She clutched the Chinaman’s arm, and			
               <br data-el="lb" />forced herself to her feet. Pushing Chum Lee			
               <br data-el="lb" />aside, Hilda made her way from the saddle			
               <br data-el="lb" />shed, where they had laid her.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Outside, the sharp cold air of the Fall morn<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing was like a dash of bitter water and brought			
               <br data-el="lb" />its revivifying effect. Hilda turned in the di<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />rection of the voice she now heard clearly, for			
               <br data-el="lb" />sound carries far in a country like Alberta,</div>

            <div data-el="p">and although Hilda could clearly hear the			
               <br data-el="lb" />voices of the men, they were in fact more than			
               <br data-el="lb" />a mile from the ranch. She was obsessed with			
               <br data-el="lb" />the idea that Cheerio had been killed and that			
               <br data-el="lb" />her men had taken his murderer into the			
               <br data-el="lb" />woods and were hanging him. Oh! she			
               <br data-el="lb" />wanted a hand in that hanging. Everything			
               <br data-el="lb" />primitive and wild in her nature surged now			
               <br data-el="lb" />into being, as she made her way blindly down</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">that incredibly long hill and ran stumblingly			
               <br data-el="lb" />through the pasture lands to where the group			
               <br data-el="lb" />of men were about some strange object that			
               <br data-el="lb" />was tied and bound half sitting on a rail.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Then Hilda understood, and waves of unholy			
               <br data-el="lb" />joy swept over her in a flood. They were tar<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ring and feathering Holy Smoke!</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Above the deafening roar of the cheering			
               <br data-el="lb" />shouting voices, presently rose the clear call			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the one she knew. No fluttering, stammer<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ing tongue now. The voice of a captain, a			
               <br data-el="lb" />leader among men:</div>
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="q">“One, two, three! In she goes!”</span></div>

               <br data-el="lb" />the man they had tarred and feathered. The
