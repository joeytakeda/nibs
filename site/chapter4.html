               <br data-el="lb" />with them all. He considered it child’s play			
               <br data-el="lb" />to have beaten them. P. D. had issued a chal<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />lenge not merely to the eastern holders of the

               <br data-el="lb" />this noble game. Though good players, they			
               <br data-el="lb" />had inherited neither their parent’s craft nor			
               <br data-el="lb" />passion for it. Indeed, they had reason to fear			
               <br data-el="lb" />and dislike chess as a veritable enemy. Many			
               <br data-el="lb" />a ranch or barn dance, many a gymkhanna,			
               <br data-el="lb" />rodeo; stampede and Indian race; many a trip			
               <br data-el="lb" />to Calgary or Banff had been wiped off			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda’s pleasure slate, as punishment for a			
               <br data-el="lb" />careless move or inattention when the ancient			
               <br data-el="lb" />game was in progress. Many a night the			
               <br data-el="lb" />bitter-hearted Sandy had departed early, sup<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />perless, to bed, because of a boyish trick of			
               <br data-el="lb" />wriggling while his father debated in long<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />drawn-out study and thought the desirability

               <br data-el="lb" />always with a sense of unholy elation and

               <br data-el="lb" />the world in general and the inhabitants of			
               <br data-el="lb" />O Bar O in particular. On the other hand,			
               <br data-el="lb" />should such excursions have proven fruitless,			
               <br data-el="lb" />the old monomaniac came back to his ranch in			
               <br data-el="lb" />uncertain and irascible humour. All hands			
               <br data-el="lb" />upon the place then found it expedient and			
               <br data-el="lb" />wise to give him a wide berth, while his un<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fortunate son and daughter were reduced to

               <br data-el="lb" />him. The ranch was a permanent institution.			
               <br data-el="lb" />O Bar O was the show-place of the foothills			
               <br data-el="lb" />and a matter of pride to the country. The

               <br data-el="lb" />in fact, and had brought to the ranch some of			
               <br data-el="lb" />the best of the bronco busters and riders.			
               <br data-el="lb" />The outfit could not, in fact, be beaten. The

               <br data-el="lb" />to the jagged outline of those misty mountains,			
               <br data-el="lb" />towering against the sun-favoured sky, the pen			
               <br data-el="lb" />pictures he drew of the men and the silhouette			
               <br data-el="lb" />shadows of ranch buildings and bush; the wild			
               <br data-el="lb" />flowers he carried into the bunkhouse and			
               <br data-el="lb" />cherished with water and sun; these and other			
               <br data-el="lb" /><span data-el="q">“soft”</span> actions, which had at first brought upon			
               <br data-el="lb" />him the amused contempt of the men, slowly			
               <br data-el="lb" />won at last their rough respect and approval.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />by a golden spell, and a brooding silence
