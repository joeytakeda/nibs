               <br data-el="lb" />instruction of this alluring subject when chess			
               <br data-el="lb" />diverted him, much to the disappointment and			
               <br data-el="lb" />aggravation of his son. Cheerio, however,			
               <br data-el="lb" />proved a mine of information in this particu<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />lar field. He had actually once been a mem<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ber of an archeological expedition to Thibet,

               <br data-el="lb" />in the world had been dug. Sandy could have			
               <br data-el="lb" />sat by the hour listening to the tales of that			
               <br data-el="lb" />expedition and its remarkable contribution to			
               <br data-el="lb" />science. It was an even more enthralling ex<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />perience for the youngster, therefore, to per<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />sonally explore the wild canyons above the

               <br data-el="lb" />rocks what Cheerio definitely proved were			
               <br data-el="lb" />bones of a dinosaur. These immense rep<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tiles of prehistoric days were quite common			
               <br data-el="lb" />to the Red Deer district, but the new <span data-el="q">“hand”</span>			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the O Bar O had proven that they were to			
               <br data-el="lb" />be found also along the Ghost River canyons.</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />between them, according to Hilda. Sandy			
               <br data-el="lb" />evidently preferred his society to that of his

               <br data-el="lb" />listen to the endless questions popped by the			
               <br data-el="lb" />eager boy, and secretly marvel at the always			
               <br data-el="lb" />comprehensible replies of his companion.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Sometimes she was tempted to join in the dis<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />cussions; but her opinions were never solici<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ted by her brother or Cheerio. As the two			
               <br data-el="lb" />rode on, apparently oblivious of her very ex<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />istence, Hilda was torn with mixed emotions.			
               <br data-el="lb" />She had scornfully advised Cheerio not to			
               <br data-el="lb" />bother her; nevertheless, she was indignant			
               <br data-el="lb" />at thus being ignored. <span data-el="q">“I might just as well

               <br data-el="lb" />harden when they glanced in his direction.			
               <br data-el="lb" />He was not versed in the ways of a woman,

            <div data-el="p">would not have wounded him so sorely.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio was not stupid; but he was singularly			
               <br data-el="lb" />dense in certain matters. He pondered much			
               <br data-el="lb" />over the matter of how he could possibly have			
               <br data-el="lb" />offended the girl, and the thought that she			
               <br data-el="lb" />very evidently disliked him was hard to bear.			
               <br data-el="lb" />That cut deep.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Many a night, pipe in mouth, upon the			
               <br data-el="lb" />steps of the bunkhouse, Cheerio would de<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />bate the matter within himself. Why did			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda dislike him? What was there about			
               <br data-el="lb" />him that should arouse her especial scorn and			
               <br data-el="lb" />contempt? Why should her eyes harden and			
               <br data-el="lb" />her whole personality seem to stiffen at his			
               <br data-el="lb" />approach? Almost it seemed as if the girl			
               <br data-el="lb" />armoured herself against him. He could find			
               <br data-el="lb" />no answer to his questions, and his troubled			
               <br data-el="lb" />meditations would end with the dumping of			
               <br data-el="lb" />his pipe, as he shook his head again in the

            <div data-el="p">About this time, he began to draw sketches			
               <br data-el="lb" />of Hilda. He made them at odd moments; at			
               <br data-el="lb" />the noon hour, when he scratched them on the			
               <br data-el="lb" />backs of envelopes, slips of paper, a bit of			
               <br data-el="lb" />cardboard torn from a box. Presently parcels			
               <br data-el="lb" />were brought by an Indian on horseback from			
               <br data-el="lb" />the Morley Trading Store, and after that			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio began to paint the face of the girl			
               <br data-el="lb" />whom he believed hated him. It is true that			
               <br data-el="lb" />his model sat not for him. Yet she was drawn			
               <br data-el="lb" />from life, for his memory drew her back as			
               <br data-el="lb" />faithfully as though they were standing face			
               <br data-el="lb" />to face. This was all secret work, done in			
               <br data-el="lb" />secret places, and packed away in the locked			
               <br data-el="lb" />portfolio, which was in that battered grip.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Drawing and painting in this way was not at			
               <br data-el="lb" />all satisfactory to the artist, who felt that he			
               <br data-el="lb" />was not doing Hilda justice. His need of a			
               <br data-el="lb" />place, where he might work, undisturbed, was			
               <br data-el="lb" />keenly felt by him. Cheerio, as before men<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tioned, was the one <span data-el="q">“hand”</span> at the ranch who			
               <br data-el="lb" />daily visited the Ghost River for bathing</div>

            <div data-el="p">purposes. He would arise an hour before the			
               <br data-el="lb" />other men and was off on horse to the river,			
               <br data-el="lb" />returning fresh and clean for breakfast and			
               <br data-el="lb" />the long day’s work. His explorations with			
               <br data-el="lb" />Sandy and these daily expeditions to the			
               <br data-el="lb" />river had made him very well acquainted			
               <br data-el="lb" />with the Ghost River canyon. One day,			
               <br data-el="lb" />scanning thoughtfully the rockbound river,			
               <br data-el="lb" />he perceived what appeared to be a declivity			
               <br data-el="lb" />in the side of a giant rock that jutted out sev<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />eral feet above the river. Out of curiosity,			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio climbed up the cliff, and discovered			
               <br data-el="lb" />a small cave, part of which was so cleft that			
               <br data-el="lb" />the light poured through. His first thought			
               <br data-el="lb" />was of Sandy, and the fun the boy would			
               <br data-el="lb" />have exploring through what was evidently a			
               <br data-el="lb" />considerable tunnel. His next thought was			
               <br data-el="lb" />that on account of the nature of the earth, this			
               <br data-el="lb" />might prove a dangerous and hazardous un<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />dertaking for an adventurous youngster. Sud<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />denly an inspiration flashed over Cheerio.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Here was the ideal studio. Not in the tunnel,			
               <br data-el="lb" />on whose ledge he could very well keep his			
               <br data-el="lb" />work, but in that round natural chamber near</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />his drawing and painting paraphernalia to			
               <br data-el="lb" />his <span data-el="q">“studio”</span>, and after a few days he fashioned			
               <br data-el="lb" />a rude sort of easel for himself. Here on a			
               <br data-el="lb" />Sunday Cheerio worked, and during that day			
               <br data-el="lb" />of rest the ranch saw him not. He would			
               <br data-el="lb" />carry his lunch with him, and depart for the			
               <br data-el="lb" />day, much to the bewilderment of Hilda and			
               <br data-el="lb" />the disappointment of Sandy, unwilling to			
               <br data-el="lb" />abandon the Sunday morning exploration			
               <br data-el="lb" />trips. The cave was so situated that his			
               <br data-el="lb" />privacy was complete, and anyone coming			
               <br data-el="lb" />along the top of the canyon or even down the

               <br data-el="lb" />drawing those impressionistic pictures of the
