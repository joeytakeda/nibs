               <br data-el="lb" />Sandy had desired to go over a certain cliff,			
               <br data-el="lb" />incredibly steep and slippery and four hun<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />dred feet above the river. Now Sandy could			
               <br data-el="lb" />climb up and down places with the agility			
               <br data-el="lb" />and sureness of a mountain goat, but even a

            <div data-el="p">He had hoisted the grumbling boy upon his

               <br data-el="lb" />said, while the deep colour flooded all of her			
               <br data-el="lb" />face and neck:</div>

               <br data-el="lb" />Faced now with the possibility of their being			
               <br data-el="lb" />ended, she said hurriedly and with a slight			
               <br data-el="lb" />catching of her breath that made Cheerio			
               <br data-el="lb" />look at her with an odd fixity of expression:</div>

                  <br data-el="lb" />of Sandy. That’s why I come along. Sandy’s			
                  <br data-el="lb" />just a little boy, you know”</span>.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">How that <span data-el="q">“little boy”</span> would have snarled			
               <br data-el="lb" />with wrath at his sister’s designation! Even			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio’s eyes twinkled, and Hilda, to cover			
               <br data-el="lb" />up her own embarrassment, hastily pressed			
               <br data-el="lb" />her heel into her horse’s flank, and for the first			
               <br data-el="lb" />time she suffered him to ride along beside

            <div data-el="p">It was intensely still and a dim golden haze			
               <br data-el="lb" />lay like a dream over all the sky and the land,			
               <br data-el="lb" />merging them into one. Into this glow rode			
               <br data-el="lb" />the girl of the ranching country and the man			
               <br data-el="lb" />from the old land across the sea. The air			
               <br data-el="lb" />was balmy and full of the essence of summer.</div>

            <div data-el="p">There was the sweet odour of recently-cut hay			
               <br data-el="lb" />and green feed and a suave wind whispered			
               <br data-el="lb" />and fragrantly fanned the perfumed air about			
               <br data-el="lb" />them. They came out of the woods directly			
               <br data-el="lb" />into the hay lands and passed through fields of			
               <br data-el="lb" />thick oats already turning golden. A strange			
               <br data-el="lb" />new emotion, a feeling that pained by its very			
               <br data-el="lb" />sweetness was slowly growing into being in			
               <br data-el="lb" />the untutored heart of the girl of the foot<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />hills. Glancing sideways at the man’s fine,			
               <br data-el="lb" />clean-cut profile, his gaze bent straight ahead,			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda caught her breath with a sudden fear			
               <br data-el="lb" />of she knew not what. Why was it, she asked			
               <br data-el="lb" />herself passionately, that she was unable to			
               <br data-el="lb" />speak to this man as to other mene Why			
               <br data-el="lb" />could she scarcely meet his clear, straight			
               <br data-el="lb" />glance, which seemed always to question her			
               <br data-el="lb" />own so wistfully? What was the matter with			
               <br data-el="lb" />her and with him that his mere presence near			
               <br data-el="lb" />her moved her so strangely? Why was she			
               <br data-el="lb" />riding alone with him now in this strange,			
               <br data-el="lb" />electrical silence? As the troubled questions			
               <br data-el="lb" />came tumbling over one another through the

               <br data-el="lb" />think of the sunshine about them, broke over			
               <br data-el="lb" />the man’s face. She was conscious of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />terrifying fact that that smile awoke in her			
               <br data-el="lb" />breast tumultuous alarms and clamours. She			
               <br data-el="lb" />feared it more than a hostile glance. Feared			
               <br data-el="lb" />the very friendly and winning quality of it.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Impetuously the girl dug her little spurred

               <br data-el="lb" />of a late sunset, red, gold, purple, magenta			
               <br data-el="lb" />and blue. All of the country seemed tinted			
               <br data-el="lb" />by the reflected glow of the night sun. Hilda,			
               <br data-el="lb" />riding breathlessly along, had the sense of one			
               <br data-el="lb" />in a race, running to escape that which was			
               <br data-el="lb" />pursuing her. On and on, neck and neck with			
               <br data-el="lb" />the galloping horse beside her, and feeling its			
               <br data-el="lb" />rider’s gaze still bent solely upon her.</div>
