               <br data-el="lb" />siesta. Cheerio himself was accustomed to			
               <br data-el="lb" />spend his Sundays in his cave studio, but in			
               <br data-el="lb" />these latter days—since in fact Hilda had			
               <br data-el="lb" />ceased to ride with them in the evenings—even			
               <br data-el="lb" />the painting had lost its charm for him. He			
               <br data-el="lb" />spent his Sundays in the near vicinity of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />ranch house, his hopeful eyes pinned upon that			
               <br data-el="lb" />wide verandah on to which the girl now so			
               <br data-el="lb" />seldom came.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Occasionally, as on this Sunday, Sandy			
               <br data-el="lb" />would induce him into short excursions from

            <div data-el="p">Now as Cheerio paused at the bunkhouse,			
               <br data-el="lb" />he turned over in his mind such small treas<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />ures as he possessed. He had a most ardent			
               <br data-el="lb" />desire to endow Hilda with one or all of his			
               <br data-el="lb" />possessions. He was obsessed with a longing			
               <br data-el="lb" />to lay his hands upon certain treasures of a			
               <br data-el="lb" />great house that should have been his own.			
               <br data-el="lb" />His possessions at the ranch were modest</div>

            <div data-el="p">enough. His wages had been spent mainly			
               <br data-el="lb" />for paint and books. He surveyed the crude,			
               <br data-el="lb" />but adequate, book-case he had built himself,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and scanned the volumes laid upon the shelves.			
               <br data-el="lb" />After all, one could offer no finer gift than a			
               <br data-el="lb" />book. He chose carefully, with a thought			
               <br data-el="lb" />rather for what might appeal especially to a			
               <br data-el="lb" />girl of Hilda’s type than his own preferences.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">As he came around the side of the house, he			
               <br data-el="lb" />perceived that the bronco was gone. A mo<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />mentary heartshake over the thought that			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda might have gone with it, and then a			
               <br data-el="lb" />great thumping of that sensitive organ as he			
               <br data-el="lb" />saw the girl upon the steps. She was sitting in			
               <br data-el="lb" />the sunlight, staring out before her in a day			
               <br data-el="lb" />dream. Something in the mute droop of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />expressive young mouth and the slight shadow			
               <br data-el="lb" />cast by the lashes against her cheek gave Hilda			
               <br data-el="lb" />a look of singular sadness and depression and			
               <br data-el="lb" />sent her caller impetuously hurrying toward			
               <br data-el="lb" />her. He had come, in fact, directly in front			
               <br data-el="lb" />of her, before the eyes were lifted and Hilda			
               <br data-el="lb" />looked back at him. Slowly the colour swept

               <br data-el="lb" />passionate impulse of shame that fought her			
               <br data-el="lb" />natural curiosity, and caused her to put the

               <br data-el="lb" />only, poised on the window sill of the loft.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Then down she dropped squarely into the lap			
               <br data-el="lb" />of the great hay wagon. There was the			
               <br data-el="lb" />smothered sound of murmuring and scram<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />bling under the hay; the delighted bark of the			
               <br data-el="lb" />entertained dog, uncertain whether this was a			
               <br data-el="lb" />contest or a game, and then two heads, plenti<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />fully besprinkled with straw and hay arose to
