            <div data-el="p">Something in the eager, hungry way in

               <br data-el="lb" />caused him suddenly to put his hand over the			
               <br data-el="lb" />small one resting on her lap. His touch had			
               <br data-el="lb" />an electrical effect upon the girl. She started			
               <br data-el="lb" />to rise, catching her breath in almost a sob.			
               <br data-el="lb" />She stood hesitating, trembling, her hand still			
               <br data-el="lb" />held in that warm, comforting grasp. At that			
               <br data-el="lb" />moment Cheerio would have given much to be			
               <br data-el="lb" />alone with the girl. A few moments only of			
               <br data-el="lb" />this thrilling possession of the little hand.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Then it was wrenched passionately free.			
               <br data-el="lb" />Hilda was regaining possession of her senses.			
               <br data-el="lb" />The dusk had fallen deeply about them and			
               <br data-el="lb" />he could not see her face, but he felt the quick,			
               <br data-el="lb" />throbbing breath. A moment only she stayed,			
               <br data-el="lb" />and then there was only the blur of her fleeing			
               <br data-el="lb" />shadow in the night. Yet despite her going			
               <br data-el="lb" />Cheerio felt strangely warmed and most in<span data-el="pc" data-force="weak"></span><br data-el="lb" />tensely happy. He was acquiring a better
