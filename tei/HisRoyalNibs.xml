<lb/>and <q>them doegies</q>, as he called them, went in			
<lb/>a long line before him like an army in review.			
<lb/>Had events followed their natural course, the			
<lb/>cattle should have filed out of the opened gate			
<lb/>into the roadway, and across the road to the			
<lb/>south field, where, duly, they would distribute			
<lb/>themselves among the <term>hummocks</term> and <term>coulies</term>			
<lb/>that afforded the most likely places for graz<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing. On this blistering day, however, <persName>Bully			
<lb/>Bill</persName>’s formula failed. Something on the wide			
<lb/>road had diverted the course of the driven			
<lb/>steers. Having gotten them as far as the road,			
<lb/><persName>Bully Bill</persName> paused in his vociferous speech and			
<lb/>heady action to take a <soCalled>chaw</soCalled> of his favorite

<lb/>to his cheek, as with bulging eyes, he sat up			
<lb/>erectly upon his horse, and then moved for<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward into swift action.</p>
            <p>A certain pausing and grouping, a bunching

<lb/>movement of a huge <term>roan</term> steer ahead of the			
<lb/>herd, apprised the experienced cowpuncher			
<lb/>of the fact that a stampede was imminent.</p>
            <p>As he raced through the gate, <persName>Bully Bill</persName>			
<lb/>perceived the cause of the revolution of his			
<lb/>herd. Directly in the path of the animals was			
<lb/>a strange figure. Not the weary footsore tramp			
<lb/>common to the trail. Not the nervy camper,			
<lb/>applying at <placeName>O Bar O</placeName> for the usual donation of			
<lb/>milk and eggs. Neither neighbour, nor <term>Indian</term><!--Think about best way to gloss "Indian"-->			
<lb/>from <placeName>Morley</placeName>. Here was a clean tweed-clad			
<lb/>Englishman, with a grip in his hand. How			
<lb/>he had maintained his miraculous neatness			
<lb/>after forty-four miles of tramping all of the			
<lb/>way from Calgary cannot be explained.</p>
            <p>Eye to eye he faced that <term>roan</term> steer, whose			
<lb/>head sank loweringly, as he backed and swayed			
<lb/>toward that moving mass behind him, all			
<lb/>poised and paused for the charge.</p>
            <p>Time was when the Englishman had been			
<lb/>in another kind of a charge, but that is a			
<lb/>different story, and <placeName>France</placeName> is very far away			
<lb/>from <placeName>Alberta, Canada</placeName>.</p>
            <p>As the dumbfounded cowpuncher raced
            <fw type="pageNum">[10]</fw>
            <pb n="11"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
<lb/>wildly in his direction, the man afoot did a			
<lb/>strange thing. Raising on high his grip in his			
<lb/>hand, he flung it directly into the face of the			
<lb/><term>roan</term> steer. In the scattering and scampering			
<lb/>and bellowing that ensued, it was hard to dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tinguish anything but dust and a vast, moving			
<lb/>blur, as the startled herd, following the lead			
<lb/>of the <term>roan</term> steer, swept headlong down the			
<lb/>road, to where in the canyon below, the <placeName>Ghost</placeName>			
<lb/>and the <placeName>Bow Rivers</placeName> had their junction.</p>
            <p>From the direction of the corrals swept			
<lb/>reinforcements, in the shape of <soCalled>Hootmon</soCalled>,			
<lb/>a Scot so nicknamed by the outfit, because of			
<lb/>his favourite explosive utterance,<note><!--Do I need a note here?--></note> and <persName>Sandy</persName>,			
<lb/>son of the <placeName>O Bar O</placeName>, red-haired, freckled<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>faced and indelibly marked by the sun above,			
<lb/>who rode his <term>Indian bronc</term> with the grace and			
<lb/>agility of a circus rider.</p>
            <p>Into the roaring mêlée charged the yelling			
<lb/>riders. Not with the <soCalled>hobo-dude</soCalled><!--Gloss?-->, lying on			
<lb/>the inner side of the barbed-wire fence,			
<lb/>through which he had scrambled with alacrity			
<lb/>before the roan steer had recovered from the			
<lb/>onslaught of the grip, were the <soCalled>hands</soCalled> of the
            <fw type="pageNum">[11]</fw>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
<lb/>ranch concerned. Theirs the job to round up			
<lb/>and steady that panic-stricken herd; to bring			
<lb/>order out of chaos; to soothe, to beat, to drive			
<lb/>into a regulation bunch, and safely land the			
<lb/>cattle in the intended south field.</p>
            <p>Half an hour later, when the last of the tired			
<lb/>herd had passed through the south gate, when			
<lb/>the bellowings had died down and already the			
<lb/>leaders were taking comfort in the succulent			
<lb/>green grass on the edges of a long slough,			
<lb/><persName>Bully Bill</persName> bethought him of the cause of all			
<lb/>this extra work and delay. He released that			
<lb/>plug of tobacco from his left cheek, spat			
<lb/>viciously, and with vengeance in his eye, rode			
<lb/>over to where the intruder still reclined upon			
<lb/>the turf. Said turf was hard and dry, and			
<lb/>tormenting flies and grasshoppers and flying			
<lb/>ants leaped about his face and neck; but he			
<lb/>lay stretched out full-length upon his back,			
<lb/>staring up at the bright blue sky above him.			
<lb/>As <persName>Bully Bill</persName> rode over, he slowly and easily			
<lb/>raised himself to a sitting posture.</p>
            <p><said>Hi! you there!</said> bawled the foreman, in the			
<lb/>overbearing voice that had earned for him his
            <fw type="pageNum">[12]</fw>

<lb/>out here for? What d’ya mean by stirrin’ up			
<lb/>all this hell of a racket? What the hell d’ya			
<lb/>want at <placeName>O Bar O</placeName>?</said></p>
            <p>The stranger smiled up at him, with the sun			
<lb/>glinting in his eyes. His expression was guile<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less, and the engaging ring of friendliness and			
<lb/>reassurance in his voice caused the irate cow<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>hand to lapse into a stunned silence, as he			
<lb/>gaped at this curious specimen of the human			
<lb/>family on the ground before him.</p>
            <p><said>Ch-cheerio!</said> said the visitor. <said>No harm			
<lb/>done. I’m f-first rate, thank you. Not even			
<lb/>scratched. How are you?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Hootmon</persName> applied his spurs to his horse’s			
<lb/>flanks, and cantered up the hill in the direction			
<lb/>of the corrals, there to recount to an interested			
<lb/>audience old <persName>Bully Bill</persName>’s discomfiture and			
<lb/>amazement.</p>
            <p>Things move slowly in a ranching country,			
<lb/>and not every day does the Lord deposit a			
<lb/>whole <term>vaudeville act</term> at the door of a ranch			
<lb/>house.</p>

<lb/>founded foreman, winked at him broadly, and			
<lb/>then deliberately pricked the rump of the			
<lb/>unfortunate Silver Heels<!--Tag horses names?--> with a pin. Kicking			
<lb/>around in a circle, the bronco backed and			
<lb/>bucked in the direction of the man upon the			
<lb/>grass, now sitting up and tenderly examining			
<lb/>an evidently bruised shin.</p>
            <p>At this juncture, the long-suffering Silver			
<lb/>Heels developed an unexpected will of his			
<lb/>own. Shaking himself violently from side to			
<lb/>side, he reared up on his hind legs, and by a			
<lb/>dash forward of his peppery young head, he			
<lb/>jerked the reins from the hands of the sur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>prised lad, who shot into the air and nearly			
<lb/>fell into the lap of the Englishman.</p>
            <p>That individual gripped the boy’s arm			
<lb/>tightly and swung him neatly to his side.</p>
            <p><said>You leggo my arm!</said></p>
            <p><persName>Sandy</persName> squirmed from the surprisingly iron			
<lb/>grip of the visitor.</p>
            <p>The tramp, as they believed him to be, was			
<lb/>now sitting up erectly, with that sublime,			
<lb/>smooth air of cheerful condescension which			
<lb/>Canadians so loathe in an Englishman.<note><!--Some note here re: The Dukes in Alberta etc--></note></p>

            <p><said>Cheerio, old man!</said> said he, and slapped			
<lb/>the unwillingly impressed youngster upon the			
<lb/>back. <said>Not hurt much—what?</said></p>
            <p><said>Hurt—nothing! Whacha take me for?</said></p>
            <p><persName>Sandy</persName>, a product of <placeName>O Bar O</placeName>, let forth a			
<lb/>typical string of hot cusses, while the English<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man grinned down upon him.</p>

            <p><said>Oh, I say! Is this a rawnch then?</said></p>
            <p>He turned a questioning eager gaze upon			
<lb/>the foreman, who now sat with right leg rest<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing across the pummel of the saddle, studying			
<lb/>their visitor in puzzled silence. After a mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment, having spat and transferred his plug			
<lb/>from the left to the right cheek, <persName>Bully Bill</persName>			
<lb/>replied through the corner of his mouth.</p>

            <p>The other looked unenlightened, and <persName>Bully

<lb/>flicker of a wink at the delighted <persName>Sandy</persName>.</p>

            <p><said>Yer see, it’s like this. On the south side of

<lb/>and, with feminine intuition, she found the

<lb/>On the opposite side, a lock of dead-gold hair			
<lb/>curled behind the glass.</p>
            <p>Sandy had leaped off his horse, and now			
<lb/>was excitedly grasping after the treasure.</p>

            <p>In an ecstasy of derision and delight, Sandy

            <p>Hand shading his eyes, the stranger was

            <p>There was a ring of men closing in about

            <p>To the door of the cook-car, rolled the im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mense form of Tom Chum Lee, the Chinese			
<lb/>cook who dominated the grub-car of O Bar O.			
<lb/>With a vast smile of benignant humour di<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rected upon his <q>boys</q>, Lee summoned all

<lb/>that he waved generously back and forth.</p>
            <p>With immense satisfaction and relish, the			
<lb/>newcomer was taking in all of the colour and

<lb/>mockery, a haughty accent of contempt.</p>
            <p><q>Who’s his royal nibs, Bully Bill?</q></p>
            <p>Through the corner of his mouth, the fore<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>examined him with evident curiosity and			
<lb/>amusement. ‘<q>Paper-collar dudes</q>, as the			
<lb/>ranch folk called the city people, came quite			
<lb/>often to O Bar O, but this particular specimen			
<lb/>seemed somehow especially green and guile-</p>

            <p>less. A wicked dimple flashed out in the right			
<lb/>cheek of the girl, though her critical eyes were			
<lb/>still cold as she looked the man over from head</p>
            <p>to foot.</p>
            <p><q>Hi-yil You! Where do you hail from?</q></p>
            <p>As he looked up at the beautiful, saucy			
<lb/>young creature before him, the Englishman			
<lb/>was seized with one of his worst spells of stut<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tering. The impediment in his speech was			
<lb/>slight, on ordinary occasions, but when unduly			
<lb/>moved, and at psychological moments, when			
<lb/>the tongue’s office was the most desired of ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>juncts, it generally failed him. Now:</p>
            <p><q>Bb-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b——</q></p>
            <p>The girl, hands on hips, swayed back and

            <p><q>Haven't you a tongue even? What are you			
<lb/>doing in this wild country, you poor lost lamb			
<lb/>from the fold?</q></p>
            <p>He had recovered his wits, and the use of			
<lb/>his tongue. His heels came together with a			
<lb/>curiously smart and military click, and his			
<lb/>blue eyes looked squarely into the impudent</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>brown ones of the girl, laughing in his face.			
<lb/>With complete gravity, he replied:</p>
            <p><q>J-just came across to the p-promised land,			
<lb/>to try and make a home for myself and—</q> he			
<lb/>paused, smiling sunnily—‘‘and another, you			
<lb/>know.</p>
            <p><q>Now wasn’t that the great idea!</q> guyed the			
<lb/>girl, with mock seriousness. ‘And who’s the

            <p><q>Nanna! Nanna! What a sweet name!</q></p>
            <p>She was still mocking, but suddenly swung			
<lb/>the locket on its chain toward him.</p>
            <p><q>Do you know, I believe we’ve found your			
<lb/>long-lost Nanna. I was just admiring her fair,			
<lb/>sweet face inside. Catch her!</q></p>
            <p>She tossed it across to him. It dropped on			
<lb/>the stones between them. He stooped to pick			
<lb/>it up, and anxiously examined it, before turn<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing to look back at the girl with a slightly stern			
<lb/>glance.</p>
            <p><q>Righto!</q> he said. <q>Thanks for returning

            <p>For some unaccountable reason, the girl’s			
<lb/>mood changed. She tossed her head, as the			
<lb/>colour flooded her face. Something wild and			
<lb/>free in that tossing suggested the motion of a			
<lb/>young thoroughbred colt. Affecting great			
<lb/>disdain, and as if looking down at him from a			
<lb/>height, she inquired:</p>
            <p><q>Oh, by the way, what’s your name?</q></p>
            <p>He absently fished in his vest pocket, and			
<lb/>this action provoked a fresh gale of laughter			
<lb/>from the highly edified hands, in which the			
<lb/>girl heartily joined. At the laughter, he			
<lb/>looked up, slightly whistled, and said in his			
<lb/>friendly way:</p>
            <p><q>Cheerio!</q></p>
            <p><q>Cheerio!</q> repeated the girl. <q>Some name.			
<lb/>Boys, allow me—Cheerio, Duke of the O Bar

            <p>Shoved along by the men, <q>his grace</q> was

            <p>the odour of the hot food, and the rich soup			
<lb/>being slapped into each bowl along the line of

<lb/>to faint. Nevertheless, he kept what he would

<lb/>bench tables, and filled the bowl before the

<lb/>smiling instead, turned to the man on either

            <p>P. D. MCPHERSON, or <q>P. D</q>. as he was			
<lb/>better known throughout the ranching country,			
<lb/>owner of the O Bar O, was noted for his ec<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>centricities, his scientific experiments with			
<lb/>stock and grain, and for the variety and quality			
<lb/>of his vocabulary of <q>cusses</q>.</p>
            <p>An ex-professor of an Agricultural College,

<lb/>of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
            <p>Beginning with a few head of cattle im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ported from the East, P. D. had built up his			
<lb/>herd until it was famous throughout the cattle

<lb/>animal that would give both the beef of the

            <p>Holstein, had been followed with unabated			
<lb/>interest.</p>
            <p>He had been equally successful with his			
<lb/>horses and other stock. Turning from cattle			
<lb/>and stock, P. D. next expended his genius upon			
<lb/>the grain. It was a proud and triumphant day			
<lb/>for O Bar O when, at the annual Calgary Fair,			
<lb/>the old rancher showed a single stalk of wheat,			
<lb/>on which were one hundred and fifty kernels.</p>
            <p>His alfalfa and rye fields, in a normally dry			
<lb/>and hilly part of the country, were the wonder			
<lb/>and amazement of farmers and ranchers.</p>
            <p>The Government, the Railways, the Flour			
<lb/>mills and the Agricultural Colleges, sought			
<lb/>him out, and made tempting offers to induce			
<lb/>him to yield up to them his secrets.</p>
            <p>P. D. stroked his chin, pinched his lower			
<lb/>lip, drew his fuzzy eyebrows together, and			
<lb/>shook his fine, shaggy old head. He was not			
<lb/>yet satisfied that his experiments had reached			
<lb/>perfection.</p>
            <p>He'd <q>think it over</q>. He’d <q>see about it

<lb/>This way out, gentlemen! This way out!</p>
            <p>He was a rude old man, was P. D. McPher<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>son,</p>
            <p>In a way, he was obliged to be so, for other<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>wise he would have been enormously imposed			
<lb/>on. O Bar O was in the heart of the game and			
<lb/>fishing country, and was, therefore, the mecca			
<lb/>of all aspiring hunters and fishermen, to say			
<lb/>nothing of the numerous campers and motor			
<lb/>hoboes, who drove in every day upon the			
<lb/>land and left their trail of disorder and dirt			
<lb/>behind, and quite often small or large forest			
<lb/>fires, that were kept under control only by the			
<lb/>vigilance of O Bar O.</p>
            <p>The ranch was noted for its hospitality, and			
<lb/>no tramp or stranger or rider along the trail			
<lb/>had ever been turned from its door. The line,			
<lb/>however, had to be drawn somewhere, and it			
<lb/>was drawn in so far as the idle tourists, paus<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>requests for milk and eggs and gasolene and			
<lb/>the privilege of spending the night there,			
<lb/>slipped in under the bridge by the river, and			
<lb/>set up their camps on the banks of the Ghost			
<lb/>River,</p>
            <p>About the time when his wheat had brought			
<lb/>him considerable, but undesired, fame, P. D.,			
<lb/>holding his lower lip between thumb and fore<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>finger, was looking about for new experimen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tal worlds to conquer. By chance, his mother<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less son and daughter, then of the impression<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able ages of four and ten respectively, shot			
<lb/>under his especial notice, through the medium			
<lb/>of a ride down the bannister and resultant			
<lb/>noise.</p>
            <p>P. D. studied his offspring appraisingly and			
<lb/>thoughtfully, and as he looked into the grimy,			
<lb/>glooming young faces, he conceived another			
<lb/>one of his remarkable <q>inspirations</q>.</p>
            <p>It was soon after this, that P. D. founded			
<lb/>that <q>School of Nature</q>, to which were bid<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>den all of the children of the neighbouring			
<lb/>ranch country, and into which his own			
<lb/>progeny were unceremoniously dumped.</p>

            <pb n="33"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>However, when the curriculum of this Insti<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tution of Learning became more fully under<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>stood, despite the fame of its founder and			
<lb/>president, there were none among the parents			
<lb/>of the various children who felt justified in			
<lb/>sending them to the O Bar O School of Na<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ture.</p>
            <p>Even the most ignorant among them be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lieved that school existed only mainly for the			
<lb/>purpose of teaching the young minds how to			
<lb/>shoot with reading, writing, spelling and			
<lb/>arithmetic.</p>
            <p>P. D. proposed only the slightest excursion			
<lb/>into these elementary subjects. Nature, so he			
<lb/>declared, addressing the assembled farmers at			
<lb/>a special meeting, was the greatest of all			
<lb/>teachers, a book into which one might look,			
<lb/>without turning a single leaf, and learn all that			
<lb/>was necessary for the knowledge of mankind.</p>
            <p>He was convinced, so eloquently proclaimed			
<lb/>P. D., that school such as the world knew it,			
<lb/>was antiquated in its methods and wholly un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>necessary and wrong. To teach the young the			
<lb/>secrets and mysteries of nature—that alone</p>

            <p>was needed to produce a race of supermen and			
<lb/>women,</p>
            <p>One timid little woman arose, and asked			
<lb/>what <q>supermen</q> meant, and the huge, rough			
<lb/>father of the family of ten replied’ that it			
<lb/>meant <q>men who liked their supper</q>.</p>
            <p>The meeting broke up in a riot—so far as			
<lb/>P. D. was concerned, and his neighbours de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>parted with his wrathful imprecations ringing			
<lb/>in their ears.</p>
            <p>Not to be daunted by the lack of support af<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>forded him by his neighbours, P. D. set at			
<lb/>once to put his theories into practice upon his			
<lb/>helpless children.</p>
            <p>It came to pass that the children of P. D.			
<lb/>missed the advantages of the ordinary modern			
<lb/>schools. Had P. D., in fact, carried out his			
<lb/>original curriculum, which he prepared with			
<lb/>scientific detail, it is quite possible that the re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sults might have turned out as satisfactorily as			
<lb/>his experiments with cattle, pigs, sheep and			
<lb/>horses. P. D. reckoned not, however, with the			
<lb/>vagaries and impetuosities of youth and human			
<lb/>nature. Unlike dumb stock, he had fiery</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 34]</fw>
            <pb n="35"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>spirits, active imaginations, and saucy tongues			
<lb/>to deal with. He was not possessed with even			
<lb/>the normal amount of patience desirable in a			
<lb/>good teacher. His classes, therefore, were			
<lb/>more often than not punctuated by explosive			
<lb/>sounds, miraculous expletives, indignant out<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cries, and the ejection or hurried exit from the			
<lb/>room of a smarting, angry-eyed youngster, suf<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fering from the two-fold lash of parental			
<lb/>tongue and hand.</p>
            <p>Then when some of his original ideas were			
<lb/>just beginning to take substantial root in their			
<lb/>young minds and systems, P. D. fell a victim to			
<lb/>a new and devastating passion, which was			
<lb/>destined to hold him in thrall for the rest of			
<lb/>his days.</p>
            <p>Chess was his new mistress, alternately his			
<lb/>joy and his bane. Even his children were for<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gotten in the shuffle of events, and, turned			
<lb/>upon their own resources, they grew up like			
<lb/>wild young things, loose on a great, free range.</p>

            <p>rant. They knew all of the theories concerned			
<lb/>in the formation of this earth of ours, and the			
<lb/>living things upon it. They were intimately			
<lb/>acquainted with every visible and many in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>visible stars and planets in the firmament.			
<lb/>They had a plausible and a comprehensible			
<lb/>explanation for such phenomena as the milky			
<lb/>way, the comets, the northern lights, the			
<lb/>asteroids and other denizens of the miraculous			
<lb/>Alberta sky above them. They knew what the			
<lb/>west, the east, the north and the south winds			
<lb/>portended. They could calculate to a nicety			
<lb/>the distance of a thunderstorm. No mean			
<lb/>weather prophets were the children of P. D.

<lb/>Rocky Mountains, that changed the weather			
<lb/>from thirty below zero to a tropical warmth in			
<lb/>Alberta, the melting clouds in the skies, the

            <p>They could ride the range and wield the			
<lb/>lariat with the best of the cowpunchers.			
<lb/>Hilda could brand, vaccinate, dehorn, and			
<lb/>wean cattle. She was one of the best brand			
<lb/>readers in the country, and she rode a horse as			
<lb/>if she were part of the animal itself. She			
<lb/>could leap with the agility of a circus rider			
<lb/>upon the slippery back of a running outlaw,			
<lb/>and, without bridle or saddle, maintain her			
<lb/>place upon a jumping, bucking, kicking,			
<lb/>wildly rearing <q>bronc</q>.</p>
            <p>Untamed and wild as the mavericks that,

<lb/>the range unbranded and unbroken, Hilda and

            <p>young creatures of the wild upon the perilous			
<lb/>edge of maturity.</p>
            <p>Hilda was not without a comprehension of			
<lb/>certain things in life that had been denied her.			
<lb/>If her heart was untamed, it was not the less			
<lb/>hungry and ardent. Though she realized that			
<lb/>she had missed something precious and desir<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able in life, she was possessed with a spartan			
<lb/>and sensitive pride. About her ignorance, she			
<lb/>had erected a wall of it.</p>
            <p>It was all very well to ride thus freely over			
<lb/>the splendid open spaces and to wend her fear<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less way through the beckoning woods of the			
<lb/>Rocky Mountain foothills. It was fine to be			
<lb/>part of a game which every day showed the			
<lb/>results of labour well done, and to know that			
<lb/>such labour was contributing to the upkeep			
<lb/>and value of the world. Yet there were times			
<lb/>when a very wistful expression of wonder and			
<lb/>longing would come into the girl’s dark eyes,			
<lb/>and the craving for something other than she			
<lb/>had known would make her heart burn within			
<lb/>her.</p>
            <p>To appease this heart hunger, Hilda sought</p>

            <p>For a time, the Encyclopedia afforded suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cient material to satisfy at least her curiosity;			
<lb/>but presently a new source was tapped. From			
<lb/>the bunkhouse came dime novels and the			
<lb/>banned newspapers, which P. D. had more			
<lb/>than once denounced as <q>filthy truck fit for the			
<lb/>intelligence of morons only</q>. Besides these			
<lb/>were the Poltce Gazette, two or three penny			
<lb/>dreadfuls, Hearsts’, and several lurid novels of			
<lb/>the blood-and-thunder type. This precious			
<lb/>reading matter, borrowed or <q>swiped</q> by			
<lb/>Sandy and Hilda, while the men were on the

<lb/>ada. He was, however, by no means proud or			
<lb/>satisfied with this honourable title to chess			
<lb/>fame.</p>
            <p>Western Canada! One could count on the			
<lb/>fingers of one hand the number of real players			
<lb/>in the whole of the west. P. D. had played			
<lb/>with them all. He considered it child’s play			
<lb/>to have beaten them. P. D. had issued a chal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lenge not merely to the eastern holders of the			
<lb/>title, but across the line, where went his bid to			
<lb/>contest the world’s title with the Yankee			
<lb/>holders of the same.</p>
            <p>P. D. dreamed and brooded over the day			
<lb/>when he would win in an international tourna<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment that would include the chess players of			
<lb/>all the nations of the world. Meanwhile, it			
<lb/>behooved him to keep in practice, so that his</p>

            <p>skill and craft should abate by not a jot or a			
<lb/>tittle.</p>
            <p>He had taught his young son and daughter			
<lb/>this noble game. Though good players, they			
<lb/>had inherited neither their parent’s craft nor			
<lb/>passion for it. Indeed, they had reason to fear			
<lb/>and dislike chess as a veritable enemy. Many			
<lb/>a ranch or barn dance, many a gymkhanna,			
<lb/>rodeo; stampede and Indian race; many a trip			
<lb/>to Calgary or Banff had been wiped off			
<lb/>Hilda’s pleasure slate, as punishment for a			
<lb/>careless move or inattention when the ancient			
<lb/>game was in progress. Many a night the			
<lb/>bitter-hearted Sandy had departed early, sup<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>perless, to bed, because of a boyish trick of			
<lb/>wriggling while his father debated in long<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>drawn-out study and thought the desirability			
<lb/>of such and such a move.</p>
            <p>Hilda and Sandy loved their father; yet his			
<lb/>departure upon a scouting expedition on the			
<lb/>trail of a prospective chess player filled them			
<lb/>always with a sense of unholy elation and			
<lb/>ecstatic freedom.</p>
            <p>P. D.’s good or bad humour upon his return</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[41 ]</fw>

            <p>to the ranch depended entirely upon the suc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cess or failure of his quest. If success crowned			
<lb/>his pursuit, and his cravings were satisfied,			
<lb/>P. D. returned, beaming with good will upon			
<lb/>the world in general and the inhabitants of			
<lb/>O Bar O in particular. On the other hand,			
<lb/>should such excursions have proven fruitless,			
<lb/>the old monomaniac came back to his ranch in			
<lb/>uncertain and irascible humour. All hands			
<lb/>upon the place then found it expedient and			
<lb/>wise to give him a wide berth, while his un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fortunate son and daughter were reduced to			
<lb/>desperate extremities to escape his especial no<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tice and wrath.</p>
            <p>It should not be inferred from the foregoing			
<lb/>that P. D. necessarily neglected his ranching			
<lb/>interests. Chess was a periodic malady with			
<lb/>him. The ranch was a permanent institution.			
<lb/>O Bar O was the show-place of the foothills			
<lb/>and a matter of pride to the country. The			
<lb/>smoothest of beef, grass-fed steers, topped the			
<lb/>market each year, when they went forth from			
<lb/>the ranch not merely to the local stockyards,			
<lb/>but to Kansas City, Montreal, St. Louis, and</p>

            <p>Chicago, in the latter place to compete with			
<lb/>success with the corn-feds of the U.S. A.</p>
            <p>At the fairs, over the country, O Bar O stock			
<lb/>carried a majority of the ribbons, and			
<lb/><q>Torchy</q>, a slim, black streak of lightning			
<lb/>and fire, brought undying fame to its owner			
<lb/>by going over the bar of the annual horse<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>show of Calgary, with Hilda upon his back,			
<lb/>the highest peak ever attained by a horse in			
<lb/>Canada.</p>
            <p>A berth at O Bar O was coveted by all the			
<lb/>riders and cowpunchers of the country. The			
<lb/>fame of the fine old ranch had crossed the line,			
<lb/>in fact, and had brought to the ranch some of			
<lb/>the best of the bronco busters and riders.			
<lb/>The outfit could not, in fact, be beaten. The			
<lb/>food was of the best; the bunkhouses modern			
<lb/>and clean; the work done in season and in a			
<lb/>rational number of hours per day; the wages			
<lb/>were fair; first-class stock to care for; a square			
<lb/>foreman, and a bully boss. What more could			
<lb/>a man wish upon a cattle ranch? Pride per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>meated to every man-Jack upon the place.			
<lb/>Each sought to stand well in the eyes of P. D.,</p>

            <p>and his praise was a coveted thing, while his			
<lb/>anger was something to escape, and unlikely to			
<lb/>be forgotten.</p>
            <p>P. D.’s praise took the form of a resounding,			
<lb/>smashing clap upon the shoulder, a prized as<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>His anger took the form of an ungodly and

<lb/>curses midway between as the torrent poured			
<lb/>from the wrathful P. D.</p>
            <p>It may be mentioned in passing that P. D.’s

<lb/>developing a quaint vocabulary of typical O

<lb/>ment and indignation. Indeed, the first time			
<lb/>P. D.’s attention was directed toward this

            <p>P. D., his bushy eyebrows twitching over

            <p>blasted hide off him. Make him sweat like			
<lb/>hell to earn his salt. Go as far as you like,			
<lb/>but—- and here P. D.’s bushy eyebrows drew			
<lb/>together in an ominous frown, <q>give the man a			
<lb/>damned square deal. This is O Bar O, and			
<lb/>we'll have no G—- D— reflections upon the			
<lb/>place</q>.</p>
            <p>So the Englishman was <q>put through the			
<lb/>ropes</q>. Despite his greenness and seeming in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nocence, it is possible that he was wider awake			
<lb/>than any of the men who were working their			
<lb/>wits to make his days and nights exciting and			
<lb/>uproarious. He played up to his part with			
<lb/>seeming ingenuousness and high good humour.			
<lb/>If the hands of O Bar O regarded him as a			
<lb/>clown, a mountebank, a greenhorn, he played			
<lb/>greener and funnier than they had bargained			
<lb/>for.</p>
            <p>He was given steers to milk. He was as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>signed the job of <q>housemaid, nurse, chamber<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>maid, and waitress</q> to the house barn stock.

<lb/>car and bunkhouse. . All the small and mean			
<lb/>jobs of the ranch were assigned to the new-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[46]</fw>
            <pb n="47"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>comer. He was constantly despatched upon			
<lb/>foolish and piffling errands. For an indefinite			
<lb/>period, he was relegated to the woodpile of			
<lb/>the cook-house. This was a job that the aver<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>age cowman scorned. The cowpuncher and			
<lb/>ranch rider consider any work not concerned			
<lb/>with horse or cattle a reflection upon their			
<lb/>qualities as riders. Cheerio, however, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>quired a genuine fondness for that woodpile.			
<lb/>He would chop away with undiminished cheer			
<lb/>and vigour, whistling as he worked, and at the			
<lb/>end of the day, he would sit on a log and			
<lb/>contentedly smoke his pipe, as he surveyed the			
<lb/>fruit of his labours with palpable pride and			
<lb/>even vanity.</p>
            <p><q>Boastin’ of how many logs he’d split.			
<lb/>Proud as a whole hen. Hell! you can’t feaze			
<lb/>a chap like that. He’d grin if you put’m to			
<lb/>breakin’ stones</q>.</p>
            <p>Thus Bully Bill to Holy Smoke, assistant			
<lb/>foreman at the O Bar O. <q>Ho</q> as he was			
<lb/>known for short, scowled at that reference to			
<lb/>breaking stones, for Ho knew what that meant</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[47]</fw>
            <pb n="48"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>in another country across the line. Out of the			
<lb/>side of his mouth he shot:</p>
            <p><q>Why don’t cha set ’im choppin’ real logs if			
<lb/>he’s stuck on the job. Stick ’im in the timber			
<lb/>and see if he’ll whistle over his job then</q>.</p>
            <p>So <q>into the timber</q> went Cheerio, with			
<lb/>strict orders to cut down ten fifty-feet tall trees			
<lb/>per day. He looked squarely into the face of			
<lb/>the assistant foreman, and said: ‘Righto,			
<lb/>and took the small hand axe handed him by			
<lb/>the solemn-faced Hootmon, whose tongue			
<lb/>was in his cheek, and who doubled over in			
<lb/>silent mirth as soon as Cheerio’s back was			
<lb/>turned. But neither Mootmon, nor Ho, nor			
<lb/>Bully Bill, nor, for that matter, old P. D. or			
<lb/>his son and daughter, laughed when at the end			
<lb/>of the day Cheerio returned with twelve trees			
<lb/>to his credit for the day’s work. It was, in			
<lb/>fact, a matter of considerable wonder and			
<lb/>speculation as to the method employed by the			
<lb/>Englishman to achieve those twelve immense			
<lb/>trees through the medium of that small hand			
<lb/>axe. Cheerio went on whistling, kept his own			
<lb/>counsel, and was starting off the next morning</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 48]</fw>
            <pb n="49"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>upon a similar errand when Bully Bill hark<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ened to another suggestion of his assistant, and			
<lb/>beckoned him to the corrals.</p>
            <p>There was a wary-eyed, ominously still,			
<lb/>maverick tied to a post, and him Cheerio was			
<lb/>ordered to mount. He said:</p>
            <p><q>Hello, old man—waiting for me, what?</q>			
<lb/>smiled at the boy holding his head, and swung			
<lb/>up into the saddle.</p>
            <p><q>Now</q>, said Bully Bill. <q>You lookut here.			
<lb/>You ride that bronc to hell and back again, and			
<lb/>break ’er cowboy if you have to break your			
<lb/>own head and hide and heart in doing it</q>.</p>
            <p>Then someone untied the halter rope, and			
<lb/>the race was on. He was tossed over and over			
<lb/>again clear over the head of the wild maver<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ick, and over and over again he remounted,			
<lb/>to be thrown again by the wildly kicking			
<lb/>bronco. Bruised and sore, with a cut lip and			
<lb/>black eye, he pursued, caught, and again			
<lb/>and again mounted, again and again was			
<lb/>thrown, to mount once again, and to stick			
<lb/>finally like glue to the horse’s back, while the			
<lb/>hooting, yelling ring of men surrounding the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[49]</fw>
            <pb n="50"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>corrals—Hilda and Sandy upon the railings—			
<lb/>yelled themselves hoarse with derisive com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ments and directions, and then went wild with			
<lb/>amazed delight, when, still upon the back of a			
<lb/>subdued and shivering young outlaw, Cheerio			
<lb/>swept around thecorrals. He arose in his stir<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rups now, himself cheering lustily, and waving			
<lb/>that newly-acquired O Bar O hat like a boy.			
<lb/>Even Hilda begrudged him not the well<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>earned cheers, though she stifled back her own			
<lb/>with her hand upon her mouth, when she			
<lb/>found that he had observed her, and with eyes			
<lb/>kindling with pride, rode by.</p>
            <p>He was thumped upon the back, hailed as			
<lb/><q>a hellufafellow</q>, and enjoyed the pronounced			
<lb/>favour and patronage of Bully Bill himself,			
<lb/>who brought forth his grimy plug of chewing			
<lb/>tobacco, and offered a <q>chaw</q> of it to the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lishman. Cheerio bit into it with relish, nor			
<lb/>showed any sign of the nauseating effects of			
<lb/>a weed he preferred in his pipe rather than			
<lb/>his mouth,</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact, like most Englishmen			
<lb/>of his class, Cheerio was an excellent rider,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 50]</fw>
            <pb n="51"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>though his riding had not been of the sort			
<lb/>peculiar to cowboydom. However, it did not			
<lb/>take him long to learn <q>the hang of the thing</q>.			
<lb/>He dropped his posting for the easy, cowboy			
<lb/>lope, and he discovered that, while one clung			
<lb/>with his knees when on an English saddle, such			
<lb/>an action had painful and exhausting results			
<lb/>with a stock saddle. There really was some<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thing to Bully Bill’s simple formula:</p>
            <p><q>Hell! There ain’t nothin’ to this here			
<lb/>ridin’. All you got to do is throw your leg			
<lb/>over his back and—stick!</q></p>
            <p>His English training, however, stood him			
<lb/>in good stead. More than the foreman at O			
<lb/>Bar O noted and appreciated the fact that the			
<lb/>newcomer was as intimate with horses as if			
<lb/>they were human brethren.</p>
            <p>From this time on, his progress at the ranch			
<lb/>was swift, considering the daily handicaps the			
<lb/>men still continued to slip in his way. His			
<lb/>courage and grit won him at least the grudging			
<lb/>respect of the men, though, try as he might, to			
<lb/><q>pal</q> with the O Bar O <q>hands</q>, his overtures			
<lb/>were met with suspicion.</p>

            <p>There is about certain Englishmen, an at<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mosphere of superiority that gives offence to			
<lb/>men of the newer lands. The <q>hands</q> of the

<lb/>ciously and doggedly continued to cultivate his

<lb/>bulldogging and browbeating. Hootmon			
<lb/>made no bones about expressing his conviction			
<lb/>that Cheerio was a <q>mon</q>! Neither he nor			
<lb/>Cheerio revealed the fact that the better part			
<lb/>of Cheerio’s first month’s wages was in the coat			
<lb/>pocket of the Scotchman, The latter had a			
<lb/>sick wife and a new baby in Calgary. Jim			
<lb/>Hull was unlikely to forget certain painful			
<lb/>nights, when all hands in the bunkhouse			
<lb/>snored in blissful indifference to his groans,			
<lb/>while Cheerio had arisen in his <q>pink pie<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>inditing to the moon and the star-spotted skies,			
<lb/>to the jagged outline of those misty mountains,			
<lb/>towering against the sun-favoured sky, the pen

<lb/>flowers he carried into the bunkhouse and			
<lb/>cherished with water and sun; these and other

<lb/>Cheerio, half humming, half reciting the songs

<lb/>papers and tawdry literature emanating from			
<lb/>the bunkhouse. Even the Encyclopedia had

            <p>and she urged the men on to torment and make			
<lb/>uneasy the life of Cheerio.</p>
            <p>Thorny and suspicious, with her free head			
<lb/>toss, so characteristic of her young, wild na<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ture, her eyes intensely dark, fixed above his			
<lb/>head, or surveying him as from an amused

            <p>Sandy, on the other hand, had slowly but			
<lb/>completely capitulated to the man whose first			
<lb/>appearance had so amused him. In Alberta,			
<lb/>daylight lingers, in the summer time, till as			
<lb/>late as ten o’clock at night. When the day’s			
<lb/>work was done, Sandy and his new friend,			
<lb/>would depart from the ranch on a hunt that			
<lb/>was new to the cattle country. They hunted,			
<lb/>in fact, for fossils, whitened, hardened bones			
<lb/>of the original denizens of the land that had			
<lb/>existed before the Rocky Mountains had			
<lb/>sprung into being by some gigantic convulsion			
<lb/>of nature.</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Zoology was a subject that exercised an un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>canny fascination over the mind of the red<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>haired boy. P. D. had scarcely begun the			
<lb/>instruction of this alluring subject when chess			
<lb/>diverted him, much to the disappointment and			
<lb/>aggravation of his son. Cheerio, however,			
<lb/>proved a mine of information in this particu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lar field. He had actually once been a mem<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ber of an archeological expedition to Thibet,			
<lb/>from whose bowels the bones of the oldest man			
<lb/>in the world had been dug. Sandy could have			
<lb/>sat by the hour listening to the tales of that			
<lb/>expedition and its remarkable contribution to			
<lb/>science. It was an even more enthralling ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>perience for the youngster, therefore, to per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sonally explore the wild canyons above the			
<lb/>Ghost River, and, with bated excitement, |			
<lb/>himself assist in picking out on the gigantic			
<lb/>rocks what Cheerio definitely proved were			
<lb/>bones of a dinosaur. These immense rep<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tiles of prehistoric days were quite common			
<lb/>to the Red Deer district, but the new <q>hand</q>			
<lb/>of the O Bar O had proven that they were to

            <p>Many atime, sitting on the bank of			
<lb/>the river, waiting for the wary trout to			
<lb/>bite, the slowly-drawling, seldom-stammering			
<lb/>Cheerio, pictured to the bulging-eyed, open<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mouthed youngster, the giant reptiles and			
<lb/>mountainous mammals of prehistoric days.			
<lb/>He even drew life-like pictures upon scraps			
<lb/>of paper, which Sandy carefully cherished			
<lb/>and consigned to his treasure drawer. Sandy,			
<lb/>at such times, came as near to touching com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>plete satisfaction with life as was possible.</p>
            <p>His defection, in favour of Cheerio, how<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ever, was a bitter pill for his sister to swal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>low. Argue and squabble, wrangle and fight			
<lb/>as the young McPherson’s had done all of			
<lb/>their lives, for they were of a healthy, pugna<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cious disposition, they nevertheless had al<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ways been first-rate chums, and in a way, a			
<lb/>defensive and offensive alliance to which no			
<lb/>outsider had been permitted more than a			
<lb/>look-in. Now <q>that Englishman</q> had come			
<lb/>between them, according to Hilda. Sandy			
<lb/>evidently preferred his society to that of his			
<lb/>own and only sister. Thus, bitter Hilda.</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Sandy upbraided, reproached and sneered at,			
<lb/>grouchily allowed that she could come along			
<lb/>too if she wanted to and <q>didn’t interfere or			
<lb/>talk too much</q>. Girls, he brutally averred,			
<lb/>were a doggone, darned old nuisance, and al<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ways in the way when something real was be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing done. They were well enough as orna<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ments, said Sandy, but the female of the spe<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cies was not meant for practical purposes and			
<lb/>they ought to know and keep their place, and			
<lb/>if they wouldn’t do it, why they’d be made to.			
<lb/>This was adding insult to injury. It proved			
<lb/>beyond question that someone had _ been			
<lb/><q>setting her brother against her</q>, and Hilda			
<lb/>knew who that someone was. Sandy knew			
<lb/>absolutely nothing about the <q>female of the			
<lb/>species</q>—that, by the way, was a brand new			
<lb/>expression to the young McPhersons—and			
<lb/>Hilda proposed to <q>teach him a thing or two</q>			
<lb/>about her much maligned sex. Also she			
<lb/>would <q>spite that Englishman</q> who had in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fluenced her brother against her, by imposing			
<lb/>her unwanted society upon the explorers.			
<lb/>Each evening, therefore, Hilda was on</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[59]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>hand, and she arose before dawn of a Sunday			
<lb/>morning—a time when all hands on the ranch			
<lb/>were accustomed to sleep in late—to ride out			
<lb/>with them under the grey-gold skies, with the			
<lb/>air fresh and sparkling, and such a stillness			
<lb/>on all sides that one felt loth to break it by			
<lb/>even a murmur.</p>
            <p>She rode somewhat behind the <q>bone en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thusiasts</q>, disdaining to ride abreast with			
<lb/>them, or to join in the unintelligible conversa<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tion that presently would begin. No brush			
<lb/>was too thick to hold back this girl of the			
<lb/>ranching country; no trail too intricate or			
<lb/>tortuous. Foot wide ledges, over precipices			
<lb/>three and four hundred feet above the river			
<lb/>daunted her not. Hilda held her careless			
<lb/>. seat on the back of her surefooted and fleet			
<lb/>young Indian pony, and if the path crumbled			
<lb/>away in places too perilous for even a foothill			
<lb/>horse to pass, Hilda dismounted and led him,			
<lb/>breaking a trail herself through dense timber			
<lb/>land.</p>
            <p>True, bones, whether of prehistoric man or			
<lb/>mammal, had no actual interest for the living</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 60 ]</fw>
            <pb n="61"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>girl. Sandy’s passion for such things indeed			
<lb/>puzzled and troubled her, inasmuch as she			
<lb/>was unable to share it with him. It was			
<lb/>strangely sweet and pleasant, none the less, to			
<lb/>ride out in the quiet dawn or in the evening			
<lb/>when the skies were bronzed and reddened by			
<lb/>the still lingering sun. With every day, they			
<lb/>found new trails, new byways, new depres<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sions in the wild woods of O Bar O.</p>
            <p>On these excursions Sandy monopolized			
<lb/>the conversation and, in a measure, Hilda			
<lb/>was ignored. Cheerio’s concern in her behalf			
<lb/>when first they had penetrated into difficult</p>
            <p>woods and his offer to lead her horse had met			
<lb/>with haughty and bitter rebuff. Hilda, in-</p>
            <p>deed, rudely suggested that she was better			
<lb/>able to care for herself than he was. Also she			
<lb/>said:</p>
            <p><q>Don’t bother about me. Ride on with			
<lb/>Sandy. I like to ride alone, and I don’t care			
<lb/>for conversation when I ride</q>.</p>
            <p>Sandy more than made up for his sister’s			
<lb/>conversational deficiency. He was a human			
<lb/>interrogation point, and his hunger for’</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[61]</fw>
            <pb n="62"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>knowledge in matters anent man and beast of			
<lb/>ancient days was unquenchable.</p>
            <p>Hilda, riding a few paces behind, would			
<lb/>listen to the endless questions popped by the			
<lb/>eager boy, and secretly marvel at the always			
<lb/>comprehensible replies of his companion.			
<lb/>Sometimes she was tempted to join in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cussions; but her opinions were never solici<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ted by her brother or Cheerio. As the two			
<lb/>rode on, apparently oblivious of her very ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>istence, Hilda was torn with mixed emotions.			
<lb/>She had scornfully advised Cheerio not to			
<lb/>bother her; nevertheless, she was indignant			
<lb/>at thus being ignored. <q>I might just as well			
<lb/>be an old pack pony</q>, she thought wrathfully.			
<lb/><q>T don’t know why I come along anyway.			
<lb/>However, I’m not going to turn back for that			
<lb/>Englishman. Not if I know it</q>.</p>
            <p>Cheerio, on the other hand, was not insen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sible to that small, uplifted chin and the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dainful glance of the dark eyes that seemed to			
<lb/>harden when they glanced in his direction.			
<lb/>He was not versed in the ways of a woman,			
<lb/>or it may be that Hilda’s treatment of him</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 62 ]</fw>
            <pb n="63"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>would not have wounded him so sorely.			
<lb/>Cheerio was not stupid; but he was singularly			
<lb/>dense in certain matters. He pondered much			
<lb/>over the matter of how he could possibly have			
<lb/>offended the girl, and the thought that she			
<lb/>very evidently disliked him was hard to bear.			
<lb/>That cut deep.</p>
            <p>Many a night, pipe in mouth, upon the			
<lb/>steps of the bunkhouse, Cheerio would de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>bate the matter within himself. Why did			
<lb/>Hilda dislike him? What was there about			
<lb/>him that should arouse her especial scorn and			
<lb/>contempt? Why should her eyes harden and			
<lb/>her whole personality seem to stiffen at his			
<lb/>approach? Almost it seemed as if the girl			
<lb/>armoured herself against him. He could find			
<lb/>no answer to his questions, and his troubled			
<lb/>meditations would end with the dumping of			
<lb/>his pipe, as he shook his head again in the			
<lb/>puzzle of womanhood, and ruefully turned in</p>
            <p>for the night. Sometimes he would lie awake			
<lb/>for hours, and wholly against his will the vis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ion of her small, dark face, with its scarlet</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 63 ]</fw>
            <pb n="64"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>lips and deep brown eyes accompanied him			
<lb/>into the world of sleep.</p>
            <p>About this time, he began to draw sketches			
<lb/>of Hilda. He made them at odd moments; at			
<lb/>the noon hour, when he scratched them on the			
<lb/>backs of envelopes, slips of paper, a bit of			
<lb/>cardboard torn from a box. Presently parcels			
<lb/>were brought by an Indian on horseback from			
<lb/>the Morley Trading Store, and after that			
<lb/>Cheerio began to paint the face of the girl			
<lb/>whom he believed hated him. It is true that			
<lb/>his model sat not for him. Yet she was drawn			
<lb/>from life, for his memory drew her back as			
<lb/>faithfully as though they were standing face			
<lb/>to face. This was all secret work, done in			
<lb/>secret places, and packed away in the locked			
<lb/>portfolio, which was in that battered grip.			
<lb/>Drawing and painting in this way was not at			
<lb/>all satisfactory to the artist, who felt that he			
<lb/>was not doing Hilda justice. His need of a			
<lb/>place, where he might work, undisturbed, was			
<lb/>keenly felt by him. Cheerio, as before men<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tioned, was the one <q>hand</q> at the ranch who			
<lb/>daily visited the Ghost River for bathing</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 64 ]</fw>
            <pb n="65"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>purposes. He would arise an hour before the			
<lb/>other men and was off on horse to the river,			
<lb/>returning fresh and clean for breakfast and			
<lb/>the long day’s work. His explorations with			
<lb/>Sandy and these daily expeditions to the			
<lb/>river had made him very well acquainted			
<lb/>with the Ghost River canyon. One day,			
<lb/>scanning thoughtfully the rockbound river,			
<lb/>he perceived what appeared to be a declivity			
<lb/>in the side of a giant rock that jutted out sev<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>eral feet above the river. Out of curiosity,			
<lb/>Cheerio climbed up the cliff, and discovered			
<lb/>a small cave, part of which was so cleft that			
<lb/>the light poured through. His first thought			
<lb/>was of Sandy, and the fun the boy would			
<lb/>have exploring through what was evidently a			
<lb/>considerable tunnel. His next thought was			
<lb/>that on account of the nature of the earth, this			
<lb/>might prove a dangerous and hazardous un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dertaking for an adventurous youngster. Sud<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>denly an inspiration flashed over Cheerio.			
<lb/>Here was the ideal studio. Not in the tunnel,			
<lb/>on whose ledge he could very well keep his			
<lb/>work, but in that round natural chamber near</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 65 ]</fw>
            <pb n="66"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the opening, when the north light was hus<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>banded. It did not take him long to bring			
<lb/>his drawing and painting paraphernalia to			
<lb/>his <q>studio</q>, and after a few days he fashioned			
<lb/>a rude sort of easel for himself. Here on a			
<lb/>Sunday Cheerio worked, and during that day			
<lb/>of rest the ranch saw him not. He would			
<lb/>carry his lunch with him, and depart for the			
<lb/>day, much to the bewilderment of Hilda and			
<lb/>the disappointment of Sandy, unwilling to			
<lb/>abandon the Sunday morning exploration			
<lb/>trips. The cave was so situated that his			
<lb/>privacy was complete, and anyone coming			
<lb/>along the top of the canyon or even down the			
<lb/>river itself could not have seen the man in the			
<lb/>cave a few feet above, quietly smoking and			
<lb/>drawing those impressionistic pictures of the			
<lb/>ranch, the Indians, the cowboys, P.D., the			
<lb/>overall-clad Sandy and Hilda. Hilda on			
<lb/>horse, flying like the wind at the head of the			
<lb/>cowboys; Hilda, loping slowly along the			
<lb/>trail, with her head dropped in a day dream,			
<lb/>that brought somehow a singularly wistful			
<lb/>and touching expression of longing to the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[66]</fw>
            <pb n="67"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>lovely young face; Hilda with hand on hip,			
<lb/>head tossed up, defiant, impudent, fascinat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing; Hilda’s head, with its crown of choco<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>late-coloured hair and the darker eyes, the			
<lb/>curiously dusky red that seemed burned by			
<lb/>the sun into her cheeks, and the lips that were			
<lb/>so vividly alive and scarlet.</p>
            <p>Of all his subjects, she alone he drew from			
<lb/>memory. He had found no difficulty in in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ducing his other subjects to <q>pose</q> for him.			
<lb/>Even P. D. with old pipe twisted in the			
<lb/>corner of his mouth had made no demur when			
<lb/>Cheerio, pad and pencil in hand, seated on			
<lb/>the steps of the ranch-house rapidly sketched			
<lb/>his employer. The Indians were a never<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>failing source of inspiration to the artist. The			
<lb/>chubby babies, the child mothers, the tawny			
<lb/>braves, the ragged, old, shuffling women;			
<lb/>Indian colours—magentas, yellows, orange,			
<lb/>scarlet, cerise. ‘They furnished subjects for			
<lb/>the artist that made his paintings seem			
<lb/>fairly to blaze with light, and later were to win			
<lb/>for him well-deserved fame and monetary re<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>sketches to his studio, and there enlarge them.			
<lb/>Hilda, however, whom above all things in the			
<lb/>world, he desired to paint, somehow eluded			
<lb/>him. No matter how lifelike or well-drawn			
<lb/>his pictures of this girl, they never wholly sat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>isfied him. Indeed it was not one of his draw<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ings, but a little kodak picture of her, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>quired from Sandy, that found its way into			
<lb/>the ancient locket, where previously had been

<lb/>that Hilda had reared between herself and			
<lb/>Cheerio was, for the nonce at least, removed.			
<lb/>Sandy had desired to go over a certain cliff,			
<lb/>incredibly steep and slippery and four hun<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dred feet above the river. Now Sandy could			
<lb/>climb up and down places with the agility			
<lb/>and sureness of a mountain goat, but even a			
<lb/>mountain goat would have hesitated to go			
<lb/>over the side of that cliff.</p>
            <p>Hilda came out of her absent trance with			
<lb/>a start, as she realized the intention of the			
<lb/>daring and reckless youngster. Over an out<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>jutting rock Sandy was poised.</p>
            <p><q>Sandy McPherson! You cut out that			
<lb/>darned nonsense. You can’t go down there.			
<lb/>It’s too doggone steep</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Guess I can if I want to</q>, retorted the			
<lb/>boy, looking over the perilous edge and			
<lb/>scrutinizing the grade for any possible root</p>

            <p>or tree stump upon which he might grasp in			
<lb/>an emergency. <q>Say</q>, his head jerked side<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ways toward Cheerio, who had dismounted			
<lb/>himself to investigate the situation. <q>Will			
<lb/>you look after Silver Heels till I get back?			
<lb/>*Tain’t safe for Aim to go over, but I'll be			
<lb/>Jake</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Sandy! You come back! Dad said the			
<lb/>earth wasn’t safe under those rocks there, and			
<lb/>any minute one of ’em might roll over. That			
<lb/>rock’s moving now! Sandy! Oh, stop him!			
<lb/>D-d-don’t let-—him! Please!</q></p>
            <p>She had appealed to Cheerio. It was the			
<lb/>first request she had ever made of him. In<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>stantly he grasped the arm of her brother.</p>
            <p><q>Come on, old man. There’s a prospect			
<lb/>over yonder that looks a jolly sight better than			
<lb/>down there</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Aw, girls give me a pain</q>, declared the			
<lb/>disgusted Sandy. <q>What do they want to			
<lb/>come spyin’ along for anyway, and throwin’			
<lb/>fits about nothin’. What do they know about			
<lb/>dinosauruses or anything else, I’d like to			
<lb/>know?</q></p>

            <p><q>On you go, old man!</q></p>
            <p>He had hoisted the grumbling boy upon his			
<lb/>horse. Sandy raced angrily ahead. Cheerio			
<lb/>looked at Hilda with the expectant boyish			
<lb/>smile of one hoping for reward. He had			
<lb/><q>taken her part</q>. Thanks were his due,			
<lb/>Thanks indeed he did not get. Hilda’s glance			
<lb/>met his own only for a moment and then she			
<lb/>said, while the deep colour flooded all of her			
<lb/>face and neck:</p>
            <p><q/><q>Now you can see for yourself what your			
<lb/>fool expeditions might lead to. Sandy’s the			
<lb/>only brother I have in the world, and first			
<lb/>thing you know he’ll be going over one of			
<lb/>those cliffs and then—then—you'll be entirely			
<lb/>to blame</q>.</p>
            <p>Discomfited, Cheerio lost the use of his			
<lb/>tongue. After a moment he inquired, some<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>what dejectedly:</p>
            <p><q>Sh-shall we c-c-c-call them off then?</q></p>
            <p>Hilda was unprepared for this. Though			
<lb/>she would not have admitted it to herself for			
<lb/>anything in the world, those evening rides			
<lb/>were becoming the most important events in</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[71]</fw>
            <pb n="72"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>her life. Indeed, she found herself looking			
<lb/>forward to and thinking of them all day.			
<lb/>Faced now with the possibility of their being			
<lb/>ended, she said hurriedly and with a slight			
<lb/>catching of her breath that made Cheerio			
<lb/>look at her with an odd fixity of expression:</p>
            <p><q>No, no—of course not. I wouldn’t want			
<lb/>to disappoint my brother, b-but I can’t			
<lb/>trust that boy alone. I’ve always taken care			
<lb/>of Sandy. That’s why I come along. Sandy’s			
<lb/>just a little boy, you know</q>.</p>
            <p>How that <q>little boy</q> would have snarled			
<lb/>with wrath at his sister’s designation! Even			
<lb/>Cheerio’s eyes twinkled, and Hilda, to cover			
<lb/>up her own embarrassment, hastily pressed			
<lb/>her heel into her horse’s flank, and for the first			
<lb/>time she suffered him to ride along beside			
<lb/>her.</p>
            <p>It was intensely still and a dim golden haze			
<lb/>lay like a dream over all the sky and the land,			
<lb/>merging them into one. Into this glow rode			
<lb/>the girl of the ranching country and the man			
<lb/>from the old land across the sea. The air			
<lb/>was balmy and full of the essence of summer.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[72]</fw>
            <pb n="73"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>There was the sweet odour of recently-cut hay			
<lb/>and green feed and a suave wind whispered			
<lb/>and fragrantly fanned the perfumed air about			
<lb/>them. They came out of the woods directly			
<lb/>into the hay lands and passed through fields of			
<lb/>thick oats already turning golden. A strange			
<lb/>new emotion, a feeling that pained by its very			
<lb/>sweetness was slowly growing into being in			
<lb/>the untutored heart of the girl of the foot<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>hills. Glancing sideways at the man’s fine,			
<lb/>clean-cut profile, his gaze bent straight ahead,			
<lb/>Hilda caught her breath with a sudden fear			
<lb/>of she knew not what. Why was it, she asked			
<lb/>herself passionately, that she was unable to			
<lb/>speak to this man as to other mene Why			
<lb/>could she scarcely meet his clear, straight			
<lb/>glance, which seemed always to question her			
<lb/>own so wistfully? What was the matter with			
<lb/>her and with him that his mere presence near			
<lb/>her moved her so strangely? Why was she			
<lb/>riding alone with him now in this strange,			
<lb/>electrical silence? As the troubled questions			
<lb/>came tumbling over one another through the			
<lb/>girl’s mind, Cheerio suddenly turned in his</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">C73]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>saddle and directly sought her gaze. A won<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>derful, a winning smile, which made Hilda			
<lb/>think of the sunshine about them, broke over			
<lb/>the man’s face. She was conscious of the			
<lb/>terrifying fact that that smile awoke in her			
<lb/>breast tumultuous alarms and clamours. She			
<lb/>feared it more than a hostile glance. Feared			
<lb/>the very friendly and winning quality of it.</p>
            <p>Impetuously the girl dug her little spurred			
<lb/>heels into her horse’s flanks and rode swiftly			
<lb/>ahead.</p>
            <p>It was nearly ten o’clock, yet the skies were			
<lb/>incredibly bright and in the west above the			
<lb/>wide range of mountains, shone the splendour			
<lb/>of a late sunset, red, gold, purple, magenta			
<lb/>and blue. All of the country seemed tinted			
<lb/>by the reflected glow of the night sun. Hilda,			
<lb/>riding breathlessly along, had the sense of one			
<lb/>in a race, running to escape that which was			
<lb/>pursuing her. On and on, neck and neck with			
<lb/>the galloping horse beside her, and feeling its			
<lb/>rider’s gaze still bent solely upon her.</p>
            <p>Presently there was a slackening of the run<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ning speed; gradually the galloping turned to</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 74]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the shorter trot. Daisy and Jim Crow, pant<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing from the long race, slowed down to a lope.			
<lb/>Some of the fever had run out of Hilda’s			
<lb/>blood and she had recovered her composure.			
<lb/>Silence for a long interval, while they rode			
<lb/>steadily on into the immense sun glow. Then:			
<lb/><q>R-ripping, isn’t it?</q> said the man, softly.			
<lb/><q>Meaning what?</q> demanded the girl,			
<lb/>angry with herself that her voice was tremu-</p>
            <p>lous.</p>
            <p>Almost they seemed to be riding into the			
<lb/>sky itself. Sky and earth had the curious phe<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nomenon of being one.</p>
            <p><q>Everything</q>, he replied, with an eloquent			
<lb/>motion of his hand. <q>It’s a r-ripping—land!			
<lb/>I'm jolly glad I came</q>.</p>
            <p><q>T don’t suppose</q>, said Hilda, <q>that you			
<lb/>have skies like this in England</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Hardly</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Tt’s foggy and dark there, I’ve heard</q>,			
<lb/>said Hilda.</p>
            <p>He glanced at her, as if slightly surprised.</p>
            <p><q>Why no, that hardly describes it, you			
<lb/>know</q>.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">(75]</fw>
            <pb n="76"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>He was thoughtful a moment, and then			
<lb/>said, with a smile, as if glad to reassure her:</p>
            <p><q>Tt’s a dashed fine place, all the same.			
<lb/>C-carn’t beat it, you know</q>.</p>
            <p>That brought the girl’s chin up. For some			
<lb/>reason, she could not have analyzed, it hurt			
<lb/>and offended her to hear him praising the			
<lb/>land from which he had come.</p>
            <p><q>Hm! I wonder why Englishmen who			
<lb/>think so darned much of their own old land			
<lb/>bother to come to wild outlandish places like			
<lb/>Canada</q>.</p>
            <p>If she had expected him to deny that			
<lb/>Canada was wild and outlandish she was to			
<lb/>be disappointed, for he replied eagerly:</p>
            <p><q>Oh, by Jove! th-that’s wh-why we like it,			
<lb/>you know. It’s—it’s exhilarating—the differ<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ence—the change from things over there.			
<lb/>One gets in a rut in the old land and travel is			
<lb/>our only antidote</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda had never travelled. She had never			
<lb/>been outside the Province of Alberta. Cal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gary and Banff were the only cities Hilda had			
<lb/>ever been in. She was conscious now of a</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 76 ]</fw>
            <pb n="77"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>sense of extreme bitterness and pain. Like			
<lb/>some young wounded creature who strikes			
<lb/>out blindly when hurt, Hilda said:</p>
            <p><q>Look here, Mr. Whatever your			
<lb/>name is, if you Englishmen just come out to			
<lb/>Canada out of curiosity and to——</q></p>
            <p><q>But, my dear child, Canada is part of us!			
<lb/>We’re all one family. I’m at home here</q>.</p>
            <p><q>No, you’re not. You're a fish out of			
<lb/>water</q>.</p>
            <p>er</p>
            <p/>
            <p><q>T s-say</q></p>
            <p><q>And look here, I don’t let anyone call me			
<lb/>‘dear child.’ I won’t be patronized by you			
<lb/>or anyone like you. I’m not a child anyway.			
<lb/>I’m eighteen and that’s being of age, if you			
<lb/>want to know</q>.</p>
            <p>He could not restrain the smile that came			
<lb/>despite himself at this childish statement.			
<lb/>Hilda’s face darkened, and her eyelids were			
<lb/>smarting with the angry tears that, much to			
<lb/>her indignation, seemed to be trying to force			
<lb/>their way through. She said roughly, in an			
<lb/>effort to hide the impending storm:</p>
            <p><q>Anyway you can’t tell me that there is any-</q></p>

            <p>thing whatsoever in England to compare			
<lb/>with—that—for instance.</p>
            <p>Her quirt made an eloquent motion toward			
<lb/>the west, along the complete horizon of which			
<lb/>the long line of jagged peaks were silhouetted			
<lb/>against the gilded skies.</p>
            <p><q>Righto!</q> said the man, softly and then			
<lb/>after a pause he added almost gently, and as			
<lb/>if he were recalling something to memory:			
<lb/><q>But I doubt if there’s anything rarer than			
<lb/>our English country lanes—lawns—fine old			
<lb/>places—the streams—but you must see it all			
<lb/>some day</q>.</p>
            <p>When he spoke, when he looked like that,			
<lb/>with the faraway absent expression in his			
<lb/>eyes. Hilda had a passionate sense of rebel<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lion and resentment. For some reason she			
<lb/>could not have explained she begrudged him			
<lb/>his thought of England. It tormented her to			
<lb/>think that the man beside her was homesick.			
<lb/>Her quirt flicked above Daisy’s neck. A			
<lb/>short swift gallop and back again to the lope			
<lb/>of the cow ponies. The ride had whipped			
<lb/>the colour into her cheeks and brought back</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the fire to her eyes. She was ready now with			
<lb/>the burning questions that for days she had			
<lb/>ached to have answered.</p>
            <p><q>If England’s such a remarkable place,			
<lb/>why do you come to Canada to make a home			
<lb/>for this—what was her name, did you say?</q></p>
            <p><q>Her namer Oh, I see—you mean—			
<lb/>Nanna</q>.</p>
            <p>He said the name softly, almost tenderly,			
<lb/>and Hilda’s breath came and went with the			
<lb/>sudden surge of unreasonable fury that swept			
<lb/>over her. He answered her lightly, deliber<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ately begging the question.</p>
            <p><q>Why not? This is the p-p-promised

            <p><q>No—never. I s-said that quite seriously</q>.</p>
            <p>She shot her next question roughly. She

<lb/>Undoubtedly she was the woman of the

            <p><q>Lovely</q>, said Cheerio. Something had			
<lb/>leaped into his eyes—something bright and			
<lb/>eager. He leaned toward Hilda with the im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pulse to confide in her, but the look on the			
<lb/>girl’s face repelled him, so that he drew back			
<lb/>confounded and puzzled. Hilda set her			
<lb/>little white teeth tightly together, put up her			
<lb/>nose, and, with a toss of her head, said:</p>

<lb/>Daisy! get a wiggle on you, you old poke</q>.</p>
            <p>She was off on the last lap of the journey.</p>
            <p>In her room, she faced herself in the wide			
<lb/>mirror and revealed a remarkable circum<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>stance so far as she was concerned. Tears,			
<lb/>bitter and scorching, were running down her			
<lb/>face. Clinching her hands, she said to the			
<lb/>tear-stained vision in the mirror:</p>

            <p>For some days Cheerio’s discourse on masto<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dons, dinosaurs and the various species of			
<lb/>the prehistoric days had been extremely vague			
<lb/>and unsatisfactory to his disciple. Matters			
<lb/>reached a climax upon this especial Sunday,			
<lb/>when he had wandered from the matter of a			
<lb/>fossil skeleton recently discovered on the Red

            <p>feet long and at least seventy feet tall, with a			
<lb/>sudden question that brought a snort of dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gust from the intensely-interested Sandy.</p>
            <p><q>What’s she got to do with the Mezzozoic			
<lb/>ager</q> he exploded.</p>
            <p>(Note: Cheerio had digressed from the ab<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sorbing matter of the age of the Red Deer			
<lb/>dinosaurs, to ask suddenly whether Hilda			
<lb/>was likely to be riding with a certain bachelor			
<lb/>rancher whose bronco was tied to the front			
<lb/>of the ranch house when the reluctant Cheerio			
<lb/>and Sandy had ridden away that morning.)</p>
            <p><q>T s-s-suppose</q>, stuttered Cheerio, <q>that			
<lb/>your s-s-sister w-w-will probably be riding			
<lb/>with her caller at the r-r-ranch</q>.</p>
            <p>Sandy’s reply was neither enlightening nor			
<lb/>respectful. He glimpsed his friend with the			
<lb/>shrewd unflattering scrutiny of a wise one, and			
<lb/>presently:</p>
            <p><q>Say, you don’t mean to tell me that you’re			
<lb/>gettin’ stuck on her too!</q></p>
            <p>That was a disturbing question, and more<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>over a revealing one. It plainly disclosed to			
<lb/>the upset Cheerio that there were others</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 86]</fw>
            <pb n="87"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p><q>stuck on</q> Hilda. In fact, Sandy left no			
<lb/>room for doubt as to that.</p>
            <p><q>Holy Hens!</q> went on Hilda’s brother.			
<lb/><q>Half the guys in this country’s got a case on			
<lb/>herf I don’t know what they see in her.			
<lb/>Should think you’d have more common sense</q></p>
            <p>than to pile along in too.</p>
            <p><q>Hilda’s eyes</q>, said the Englishman softly,			
<lb/><q>are as b-brown as loamy soil. They’re like			
<lb/>the dark earth, warm and rich and full of			
<lb/>promise</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Oh, my God—frey!</q> groaned Sandy and			
<lb/>rolled clear down the grassy slope on which			
<lb/>they had been sitting to the more intelligent			
<lb/>and sane company of Viper, a yellow and un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lovely cur who was, however, the private and			
<lb/>personal property of Sandy. Viper was at			
<lb/>that moment <q>snooping</q> above a gopher hole.			
<lb/>One intelligent eye and ear cocked up warily,			
<lb/>signalled with canine telepathy to his master			
<lb/>and pal the warning:</p>
            <p><q>Careful! She’s under there! Don’t let on			
<lb/>you and me are above her. I’ll get her for			
<lb/>you. You'll have another tail for your col-</q></p>

            <p>lection. Don’t forget there’s a gymkhanna			
<lb/>over at the Minnehaha ranch next month and			
<lb/>the prize for the most gopher tails is five			
<lb/>plunks.</p>
            <p>To this unspoken but perfectly comprehen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sible message, Sandy replied:</p>
            <p><q>Betchu we get his tail, Viper! Betchu I			
<lb/>take the prize this year! I got seventy-five			
<lb/>now. Make it seventy-six, Viper, and I’ll give			
<lb/>you eight bones for dinner to-night</q>.</p>
            <p>Cheerio, meanwhile, ruminating painfully			
<lb/>upon Sandy’s revelation, and also upon that			
<lb/>bronco tied to front of the ranch house, and			
<lb/>its good-looking owner who was inside, un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able to endure the picture his mind conjured			
<lb/>of Hilda riding off with her caller into their			
<lb/>own (his and Hilda’s) especial sun glow,			
<lb/>jumped in a hurry upon Jim Crow’s back, and			
<lb/>with the best of intentions sped back to			
<lb/>O Bar O.</p>
            <p>It was Sunday afternoon, and such of the			
<lb/>ranch hands as were not off on some courting			
<lb/>or hunting or fishing or riding expedition,			
<lb/>were stretched out on the various cots that</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 88 ]</fw>
            <pb n="89"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>lined the long bunkhouse taking their weekly			
<lb/>siesta. Cheerio himself was accustomed to			
<lb/>spend his Sundays in his cave studio, but in			
<lb/>these latter days—since in fact Hilda had			
<lb/>ceased to ride with them in the evenings—even			
<lb/>the painting had lost its charm for him. He			
<lb/>spent his Sundays in the near vicinity of the			
<lb/>ranch house, his hopeful eyes pinned upon that			
<lb/>wide verandah on to which the girl now so			
<lb/>seldom came.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, as on this Sunday, Sandy			
<lb/>would induce him into short excursions from			
<lb/>the ranch, but Cheerio was restless and unset<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tled now, and far from being the satisfactory			
<lb/>companion and oracle upon whom Sandy had			
<lb/>depended.</p>
            <p>Now as Cheerio paused at the bunkhouse,			
<lb/>he turned over in his mind such small treas<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ures as he possessed. He had a most ardent			
<lb/>desire to endow Hilda with one or all of his			
<lb/>possessions. He was obsessed with a longing			
<lb/>to lay his hands upon certain treasures of a			
<lb/>great house that should have been his own.			
<lb/>His possessions at the ranch were modest</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 89 ]</fw>
            <pb n="90"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>enough. His wages had been spent mainly			
<lb/>for paint and books. He surveyed the crude,			
<lb/>but adequate, book-case he had built himself,			
<lb/>and scanned the volumes laid upon the shelves.			
<lb/>After all, one could offer no finer gift than a			
<lb/>book. He chose carefully, with a thought			
<lb/>rather for what might appeal especially to a			
<lb/>girl of Hilda’s type than his own preferences.</p>
            <p>As he came around the side of the house, he			
<lb/>perceived that the bronco was gone. A mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mentary heartshake over the thought that			
<lb/>Hilda might have gone with it, and then a			
<lb/>great thumping of that sensitive organ as he			
<lb/>saw the girl upon the steps. She was sitting in			
<lb/>the sunlight, staring out before her in a day			
<lb/>dream. Something in the mute droop of the			
<lb/>expressive young mouth and the slight shadow			
<lb/>cast by the lashes against her cheek gave Hilda			
<lb/>a look of singular sadness and depression and			
<lb/>sent her caller impetuously hurrying toward			
<lb/>her. He had come, in fact, directly in front			
<lb/>of her, before the eyes were lifted and Hilda			
<lb/>looked back at him. Slowly the colour swept			
<lb/>like the dawn over her young face, as he ex-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[90]</fw>
            <pb n="91"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>tended the book, stammering and blushing in			
<lb/>his boyish way.</p>
            <p><q>M-m-m-miss Hilda, I r-r-recommend this			
<lb/>f-for b-b-both pleasure and information. It’s			
<lb/>p-p-part of one’s education to read Dumas</q>.</p>
            <p>Education! The word was inflammatory.			
<lb/>It was an affront to her pride. He was			
<lb/>rubbing in the fact of her appalling ignorance.			
<lb/>‘That was her own affair—her own misfortune.			
<lb/>Hilda sprang to her feet, up in arms, on the			
<lb/>defensive and the offensive. While the aston<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ished Cheerio still extended the book—a silent			
<lb/>peace offering—Hilda’s dark head tossed up,			
<lb/>in that characteristic motion, while her foot			
<lb/>stamped the ground.</p>
            <p><q>T don’t care for that kind of rot, thank you.			
<lb/>My dad’s right. It’s better to be real people			
<lb/>in the world rather than fake folk in a book</q>.</p>
            <p>Again the head toss and the blaze of angry			
<lb/>wide eyes; then, swift as a fawn, Hilda sped			
<lb/>across the verandah and the ranch house door			
<lb/>banged hard.</p>
            <p>Thus might have ended the Dumas incident,			
<lb/>but on the following day, when the men were</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[91]</fw>
            <pb n="92"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>all out on the range, she who had spurned			
<lb/><q>The Three Musketeers</q> slipped out of the			
<lb/>ranch house, over to the grove of trees to the			
<lb/>east and running behind the shelter of these,			
<lb/>so that Chum Lee should not see her as she			
<lb/>passed, made her way swiftly to the bunkhouse.</p>
            <p>Bunkhouses in a ranching country are not			
<lb/>savoury or attractive places as a general rule.			
<lb/>This of the O Bar O was <q>not too bad</q> as the			
<lb/>expression goes in Alberta. It had the virtue			
<lb/>at all events of being clean, thanks to the as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>siduous care of Chum Lee. Moreover, shift<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less and dirty fellows found a short job at			
<lb/>O Bar O. Hats and caps, hide shirts, buck<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>skin breeks, chaps and coats were all, there<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fore, neatly hung along the wall on the row of			
<lb/>deer horns, while under these were piled on			
<lb/>the long shelf the puttees, boots and other gear			
<lb/>of the riders.</p>
            <p>The bunkhouse was lavishly decorated, the			
<lb/>entire walls being covered with pictures cut			
<lb/>from magazines or newspapers or from other			
<lb/>sources and pasted or tacked upon the wall.			
<lb/>Ladies in skin tights of rounded and ample</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[92]</fw>
            <pb n="93"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>curves, in poses calculated to attract the at<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tention of the opposite sex, ravishing beauties,			
<lb/>all more or less with that stage smile in which			
<lb/>all of the dental equipment of their owners,			
<lb/>alluringly displayed, beamed down above the			
<lb/>beds of the riders of O Bar O. Hilda had seen			
<lb/>these often before and they had no especial in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>terest for her. Her glance travelled instead to			
<lb/>the long table on which was piled the treas<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ured possessions of the men, correspondence			
<lb/>boxes, tobacco, pipes, jack-knives, quirts,			
<lb/>gloves, letters and photographs of friends and			
<lb/>relatives. Nothing on that table would likely			
<lb/>belong to him. Nothing suggested Cheerio.			
<lb/>Her eye went slowly down the row of beds till			
<lb/>it came to rest upon that one pulled out from			
<lb/>the wall till the head was thrust directly un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>der the widely opened window, by the side of			
<lb/>which stood the crude book-case and stand.			
<lb/>She paused only a moment and then swiftly			
<lb/>crossed to the Englishman’s bed.</p>
            <p>Three of the shelves were filled tightly with			
<lb/>books and the bottom one held a writing folio			
<lb/>and sketch tablet. This Hilda seized upon,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[93]</fw>
            <pb n="94"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>but stopped before opening it, while the colour			
<lb/>receded from her cheeks. Within that folio,			
<lb/>perhaps, would be found some clue, some			
<lb/>letter from the woman he loved. Yes, Hilda			
<lb/>faced the fact that Cheerio loved the woman			
<lb/>whose pictured face was in the locket, and for			
<lb/>whom he had come to Canada to make a home.			
<lb/>As she held the folio in her hand, she felt a			
<lb/>passionate impulse of shame that fought her			
<lb/>natural curiosity, and caused her to put the			
<lb/>thing back upon the shelf. No! She had not			
<lb/>come to the bunkhouse to spy into a man’s cor<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>respondence. It was only that she suffered			
<lb/>from an unconquerable hunger merely again			
<lb/>to see the other woman’s face; to study it, to			
<lb/>compare it with her own—Oh! to destroy it!			
<lb/>But no, no—she would not stoop so low as to			
<lb/>look at something which he did not wish her			
<lb/>to see.</p>
            <p>The book was a different matter. He had			
<lb/>offered it to her. It was therefore really her			
<lb/>own. Thus argued Hilda within herself. A			
<lb/>quick search along the shelves and she had			
<lb/>picked out the volume she sought. It was</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 94 ]</fw>
            <pb n="95"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>marked number one in the row of books by			
<lb/>Alexandre Dumas. Thrusting it under her			
<lb/>cape, Hilda hurried to the door, and once			
<lb/>again like a scared child who has been stealing			
<lb/>apples, she slipped behind the sheltering			
<lb/>bushes, came from behind them into the open			
<lb/>and sped across the yard to the house.</p>
            <p>All of that morning, Hilda McPherson was			
<lb/>dead to the world. Lying on the great			
<lb/>fragrant heap in the hay loft, she lost herself			
<lb/>in the meshes of one of the most entrancing ro<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mances that has ever been penned by the hand			
<lb/>of man. She emerged from her retreat at the			
<lb/>dinner hour, brought back to earth by the ar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rival of the <q>hands</q> in the barn below. It			
<lb/>was haying time and the men came in from the			
<lb/>fields for their noon meal. Certain of the			
<lb/>horses were changed and relieved and brought</p>
            <p>to the stables for especial feeding. Hiding			
<lb/>her precious book under a pile of hay in a			
<lb/>corner of the loft, Hilda descended, and still			
<lb/>under the spell of the book she had been read<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing all morning, made her way to the house.			
<lb/>It so happened, that in her absorption, she</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[95]</fw>
            <pb n="96"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>had paid little attention to Sandy’s dog, who			
<lb/>leaped up at her as she passed, capered around			
<lb/>her, sought to lick her hands and otherwise in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gratiate himself. Absently Hilda ordered him			
<lb/>down.</p>
            <p><q>That will do, Viper! Now cut it out!			
<lb/>Get away! Get away! Shoooo-o-o! Bad			
<lb/>dog! Down!</q></p>
            <p>Duly admonished, spirits but slightly			
<lb/>dampened, Viper repaired to the barn, where			
<lb/>for a spell, with his tongue hanging out and			
<lb/>panting from recent long runs across the land</p>
            <p>after his master on horse, he endeavoured to			
<lb/>attract the attention of such hands as were still			
<lb/>in the barn by an occasional yelp and a moan			
<lb/>of protest when at last the doors were shut			
<lb/>upon him.</p>
            <p>For a little while Viper rested in one of the			
<lb/>stalls; then being young and of an active dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>position he arose and stretched himself and			
<lb/>looked about him for diversion. In the nat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ural course of events, having tired of chasing			
<lb/>the various hens from the stalls and vainly			
<lb/>snapping at persistent fleas, he sniffed along</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[967</fw>
            <pb n="97"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the trail over which his young mistress (he re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>garded her as such) had passed. In due time,			
<lb/>therefore, Viper arrived in the loft. Also in			
<lb/>the natural course of events, he nosed around			
<lb/>and dug under the hay, disclosing the hidden			
<lb/>book. He carried this treasure below in his			
<lb/>mouth, and was having quite a jolly time with			
<lb/>it, growling and barking and shaking it and			
<lb/>alternatively letting it go and then pouncing			
<lb/>upon it, when he was interrupted by a well<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>known and much-beloved and sometimes			
<lb/>feared whistle. Joyously, proudly, trium<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>phantly Viper brought his find to his master,			
<lb/>and with the pride of a new mother, laid it at			
<lb/>Sandy’s feet. Wagging his tail furiously and			
<lb/>emitting short, sharp yelps which spoke as elo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>quently as mere words the dog’s demand for			
<lb/>well-earned praise, he was rewarded from			
<lb/>various pockets of Sandy’s overalls. The			
<lb/>prizes consisted of bones and other edibles			
<lb/><q>swiped</q> from the kitchen through which			
<lb/>Sandy had passed like a streak en route to join			
<lb/>his dog in the barn.</p>
            <p>Sandy now <q>deine appraisingly over the</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">97 |</fw>
            <pb n="98"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>printed lines of that now ragged volume.			
<lb/>Presently his attention was drawn to one living			
<lb/>line that flashed from the page with the swift			
<lb/>play of the sword of D’Artagnan. Sandy’s			
<lb/>mouth gaped, and his gaze grew intent. Pres<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ently, still reading, he retired from the barn,			
<lb/>and, followed by Viper, climbed aboard a			
<lb/>huge hay wagon that stood beneath the open			
<lb/>window of the big loft.</p>
            <p>All of that afternoon Hilda McPherson			
<lb/>searched in vain for <q>The Three Musketeers</q>.			
<lb/>The mystery of its disappearance from the			
<lb/>loft tormented her, for she had reached a por<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tion of the tale that had to be finished. What			
<lb/>had become of Porthos when—Hilda felt that			
<lb/>she had to know the sequel of that especial			
<lb/>episode <q>or bust</q> with unsatisfied curiosity.			
<lb/>The story had seized upon her imagination.</p>
            <p>The blazing sunlight of the July afternoon			
<lb/>was softening and the mellow tone that would			
<lb/>presently settle into the misty gleam of the re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>luctantly-ending day was beginning to tint the			
<lb/>land, when Hilda looked forth from the hay</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 98]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>loft window and perceived something directly			
<lb/>below her that was brick red in colour. It			
<lb/>stuck out from a loaded hay wagon. His dog			
<lb/>curled beside him, half buried in the deep			
<lb/>hay, book propped before him, Sandy, as his			
<lb/>sister had done, had dropped out of this world			
<lb/>of ours and was soaring into realms of another			
<lb/>time.</p>
            <p>Hilda’s eyes widened with amazement and			
<lb/>righteous indignation. A moment of pause			
<lb/>only, poised on the window sill of the loft.			
<lb/>Then down she dropped squarely into the lap			
<lb/>of the great hay wagon. There was the			
<lb/>smothered sound of murmuring and scram<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>bling under the hay; the delighted bark of the			
<lb/>entertained dog, uncertain whether this was a			
<lb/>contest or a game, and then two heads, plenti<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fully besprinkled with straw and hay arose to			
<lb/>the surface and two wrathful, angry faces			
<lb/>glared across at each other.</p>
            <p><q>That’s mine!</q></p>
            <p><q>Tt ain't!</q></p>

            <p><q>That cur stole it. [hid it in the loft. You

<lb/>sorry. It’s mine</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Prove it then</q>.</p>
            <p>A tussle, a tug, a tremendous pull; back and			
<lb/>forth, a fierce wrestle; a scramble and sprawl			
<lb/>over the hay; a whoop of triumph from Hilda			
<lb/>as on the edge of the wagon, with Sandy tem<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>porarily restrained by the hay under which			
<lb/>she had buried him, she paused a second ere			
<lb/>she dropped to the ground almost into the			
<lb/>arms of the highly-edified Cheerio.</p>
            <p>Sandy at last freed from his prison of hay			
<lb/>was upon her tracks, and with a blood-curd<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p><q>T s-say, old man, b-believe that’s m-my

            <p>Hilda had turned first white and then rosily			
<lb/>red. She felt that her face was scorching and			
<lb/>smarting tears bit at her eyelids waiting to			
<lb/>drop. One indeed did roll down the round			
<lb/>sun-burnt cheek and splashed visibly upon her			
<lb/>hand right before the now thoroughly con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cerned Cheerio. His face stiffened sternly as			
<lb/>he looked at Sandy, and reaching over he re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>covered his book. Quietly he extended it to			
<lb/>Hilda. Sandy thereupon pressed his claim in			
<lb/>loud and emphatic language.</p>
            <p><q>That ain’t fair. She’s just turnin’ on her			
<lb/>old water-works so’s to make you give her the			
<lb/>book. It ain’t fair. I’m just up to that part			
<lb/>where Porthos and——</q></p>
            <p>Hilda made no motion to take the book.</p>

            <p>Two more tears rolled to join their first com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>panion. Hilda could no more have stayed			
<lb/>the course of those flowing tears than she			
<lb/>could have dammed up the ocean with her			
<lb/>little hand. She was forced to stand there,			
<lb/>openly crying, before the man she had so often			
<lb/>assured herself that she hated. Far from			
<lb/><q>gloating over</q> her humiliation as she			
<lb/>imagined he was doing, Cheerio, as he looked			
<lb/>at the weeping girl, was himself consumed			
<lb/>with the most tender of emotions. He longed			
<lb/>to take her into his arms and to comfort and</p>
            <p>reassure her.</p>
            <p><q>Tell you what Tll do</q>, said Cheerio,			
<lb/>gently. <q>I’ll read the story to you both. What			
<lb/>do you say? An hour or two every evening			
<lb/>while the light lasts. Wh-when we’re through			
<lb/>with this one, w-we’'ll tackle others. There’s			
<lb/>three sequels to this, and we’ll read them all.			
<lb/>Then we'll go at the ‘Count of Monte Christo.’			
<lb/>Th-that’s a remarkable yarn!</q></p>
            <p><q>Three sequels! My aunt’s old hat!</q> yelled			
<lb/>the delighted Sandy, tossing his ragged head			
<lb/>gear into the air. <q>Gee whillikins!</q></p>

            <p>But Cheerio was looking at Hilda, intently,			
<lb/>appealingly. Her face had lighted, and a			
<lb/>strange shyness seemed to come over it, reluct<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>antly, sweetly. The long lashes quivered. She			
<lb/>looked into the beaming face bent eagerly to<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>thought into the France of the Grande Mon<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>arche.</p>
            <p>Hilda indeed so lost herself each night in			
<lb/>the chronicle that she forgot her grudge			
<lb/>against the reader, and sat on one side of him			
<lb/>almost as closely, peering over his arm at the			
<lb/>page, as Sandy on the other side. Of course,			
<lb/>the steps were not wide and barely accommo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dated the three and Hilda’s place was next to			
<lb/>the wall. Cheerio sat between the two.</p>
            <p>After the readings there would follow an			
<lb/>excited discussion of the story that was almost			
<lb/>as interesting as the tale itself. It was aston<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ishing how much this Englishman knew about			
<lb/>France in the time of Louis the XIV. Sandy			
<lb/>would pepper him with questions, and some<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>the tale.</p>

            <p>Couldn’t you read just as far as where they			
<lb/>take the mask off? Did they ever take it off?			
<lb/>Say, if you set your watch by Chum Lee’s

            <p>Hilda was as concerned in the fortunes of			
<lb/>the Musketeers as her brother, but she was			
<lb/>obliged to curb her curiosity. With the end<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing of the reading, her diffidence and re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>straint would gradually creep back upon her.			
<lb/>She was not going to let this man know how			
<lb/>throbbingly interested she was. She did not			
<lb/>wish him to know how limited had been her			
<lb/>reading up to this time. That was a family			
<lb/>skeleton that was none of his business, and she			
<lb/>could have given Sandy a hard shaking when			
<lb/>he disclosed to Cheerio the type of literature			
<lb/>that he and Hilda had been <q>raised on</q>.</p>

            <p>Cheerio, with intense seriousness, assured			
<lb/>them that their father was <q>dead right</q>. That			
<lb/>sort of reading, as P. D. had declared, was

            <p><q>Well, it’s all there is anyway</q>, defended

<lb/>He says that he’ll choose all that we need to

<lb/>of his infernal youth and her own advantage			
<lb/>of being of age—the extraordinary powers			
<lb/>that descended upon her in consequence of

            <p>and went to the movies, and I just loved it,			
<lb/>and I’m going every time I get a chance. You			
<lb/>just watch me.</p>
            <p>Something in the eager, hungry way in			
<lb/>which the girl spoke touched Cheerio and			
<lb/>caused him suddenly to put his hand over the			
<lb/>small one resting on her lap. His touch had			
<lb/>an electrical effect upon the girl. She started			
<lb/>to rise, catching her breath in almost a sob.			
<lb/>She stood hesitating, trembling, her hand still			
<lb/>held in that warm, comforting grasp. At that			
<lb/>moment Cheerio would have given much to be			
<lb/>alone with the girl. A few moments only of			
<lb/>this thrilling possession of the little hand.			
<lb/>Then it was wrenched passionately free.			
<lb/>Hilda was regaining possession of her senses.			
<lb/>The dusk had fallen deeply about them and			
<lb/>he could not see her face, but he felt the quick,			
<lb/>throbbing breath. A moment only she stayed,			
<lb/>and then there was only the blur of her fleeing			
<lb/>shadow in the night. Yet despite her going			
<lb/>Cheerio felt strangely warmed and most in<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>odd moods, her chilling almost hostile attitude			
<lb/>and speech no longer distressed him. Per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>haps this might have been due to an amazing

<lb/>aggressive, loud-voiced overbearing type of</p>
            <p>personality that by sheer noise often will win			
<lb/>out in an argument and makes an impression			
<lb/>on those who are not expert students of char<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>acter. Few at O Bar O questioned the prow<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ess of which Ho everlastingly boasted, for he			
<lb/>looked the part he played. His favourite			
<lb/>boast was that he <q>could lick any son-of-a-gun			
<lb/>in Alberta, just as I licked every son-of-a-gun			
<lb/>in Montana</q> with one hand tied behind. No			
<lb/>one accepted his challenge, pugnaciously			
<lb/>tossed forth, and little Buddy Wallace, one of			
<lb/>P. D.’s diminutive jockies, hurriedly retreated			
<lb/>when the big fellow merely stretched out a			
<lb/>clinched fist toward him.</p>
            <p>Even Bully Bill, himself somewhat of a			
<lb/>blusterer, discovered in Ho a personality more			
<lb/>domineering than his own. It was uncomfort<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able to have the big bully around, but the fore<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man had never quite screwed up the courage to</p>

            <p><q>fire the man</q> as more than once P. D. had			
<lb/>suggested. Easy-going and good-natured			
<lb/>Bully Bill had suffered Ho to remain all of			
<lb/>that summer, enduring meanwhile the fellow’s			
<lb/>arrogance and boasts and even threats of vio<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lence to each and every hand upon the place.			
<lb/>He had wormed his way to the position of tem<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>porary assistant foreman, as Bully Bill had dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>covered that the men took orders from him as			
<lb/>meekly as from P. D. himself. This was up			
<lb/>to the time that Cheerio drifted into O Bar O.			
<lb/>Soon after that memorable day, another even			
<lb/>more important in the annals of O Bar O			
<lb/>dawned that not only elevated the Englishman			
<lb/>permanently from the woodpile and chores to			
<lb/>the proud position of first rider. but lost Ho			
<lb/>his prestige in the cattle country.</p>
            <p>The row started in the cook-car. The first			
<lb/>prod in his side had been ignored by Cheerio,			
<lb/>who had continued to eat his meal in silence,			
<lb/>just as if a vicious punch from the thick elbow			
<lb/>of the man on his right had not touched him.			
<lb/>Holy Smoke winked broadly down the length			
<lb/>of the table. At the second prod, Cheerio</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[118]</fw>
            <pb n="119"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>looked the man squarely in the eye and said			
<lb/>politely:</p>
            <p><q>T wouldn’t keep that up if I were you</q>.</p>
            <p>This brought a roar of laughter followed by			
<lb/>the third prod. There was a pause. He had			
<lb/>raised in the interval his bowl of hot soup in			
<lb/>his hands and was greedily and noisily swal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lowing, when a surprising dig in his own left			
<lb/>rib not only produced a painful effect but sent			
<lb/>the hot soup spluttering all over him. Up rose			
<lb/>the huge cowhand, while in the tense silence			
<lb/>that ensued all hands held their breath in			
<lb/>thrilled suspense. As Ho cleared his vision—			
<lb/>temporarily dimmed by the hot soup, Cheerio,			
<lb/>who had also risen in his seat, said quietly:</p>
            <p><q>T d-don’t want to hurt you, you know,			
<lb/>b-but the fact is it’s got to be done. S-suppose			
<lb/>we go outside. T-too bad to m-make a m-m<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mess of Chum Lee’s car</q>.</p>
            <p>Holy Smoke snorted, hitched his trousers			
<lb/>up by the belt, and then in ominous silence he			
<lb/>accompanied the Englishman, followed by</p>
            <p>every man in the cook-car, including Chum			
<lb/>Lee.</p>
            <p>s</p>

            <pb n="120"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>A ring was made in short order and into the			
<lb/>ring went the snorting, loudly-laughing Ho			
<lb/>and the lean, quiet young Englishman.</p>
            <p><q>T hate this sort of a thing</q>, said Cheerio,			
<lb/><q>and if you feel equal to an apology, old man,			
<lb/>we'll let it go at that</q>.</p>
            <p>Holy Smoke retorted with a low string of			
<lb/>oaths and a filthy name that brought Cheerio’s			
<lb/>fist squarely up to his jaw.</p>
            <p>To describe that fight would require more			
<lb/>craft and knowledge than the author possesses.			
<lb/>Suffice it to say that weight and size, the			
<lb/>strength of the powerful hands and limbs			
<lb/>availed the cowhand nothing when pitted			
<lb/>against the scientific skill of one of the cleanest			
<lb/>boxers in the British army, who, moreover,			
<lb/>had studied in the east that little-known but			
<lb/>remarkable art of wrestling known as jiujitsu.			
<lb/>The big man found himself whirling about in			
<lb/>a circle, dashing blindly this way and that,			
<lb/>and through the very force of his own weight			
<lb/>and strength overcoming himself, and in the			
<lb/>end to find himself literally going over the			
<lb/>head of the man who had ducked like light-</p>

            <p>ning under him, There on the ground			
<lb/>sprawled the huge, beaten bully, who had tyr<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>annized over the men of O Bar O. His the			
<lb/>fate to come to out of his daze only to hear the			
<lb/>frantic yells and cheers of the encircling men			
<lb/>and to see his antagonist borne back into the			
<lb/>cook-car upon the shoulders of the men.			
<lb/>Holy Smoke was a poor loser. His defeat,			
<lb/>while it quenched in a measure his outward			
<lb/>show of bluster, left him nursing a grudge			
<lb/>against Cheerio, which he promised himself			
<lb/>would some day be wiped out in a less con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>spicuous manner and place. Not only had			
<lb/>his beating caused him to lose caste in the eyes			
<lb/>of the men of the ranching country, but the			
<lb/>story went the rounds of the ranches, and the			
<lb/>big cowhand suffered the snubs and heartless			
<lb/>taunts of several members of the other sex.			
<lb/>Now Ho was what is termed <q>‘a good looker</q>,			
<lb/>and his conquests over the fair sex generally			
<lb/>had long been the subject of gossip and joke			
<lb/>or serious condemnation. He was, however,			
<lb/>ambitious and aspired to make an impression			
<lb/>upon Hilda McPherson. For her this big</p>

            <p>handsome animal had no attraction, and his			
<lb/>killing glances, his oily compliments and			
<lb/>the flashy clothes that might have impressed			
<lb/>a simpler-minded maid than she, aroused			
<lb/>only her amused scorn. Herself strong and			
<lb/>independent by nature, beneath her thorny ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>terior Hilda McPherson had the tender heart			
<lb/>of the mother-thing, and the brute type of man			
<lb/>appealed less to her than one of a slighter and			
<lb/>more esthetic type.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Hilda loved little Jessie			
<lb/>Three-Young-Mans, a squaw of fifteen sad			
<lb/>years, whose white-faced blue-veined papoose			
<lb/>was kept alive only by the heroic efforts of			
<lb/>Hilda and the Agency doctor. The Morley			
<lb/>Indian Reserve adjoined the O Bar O ranch,			
<lb/>and P. D. employed a great many of the tribe			
<lb/>for brush-cutting, fencing and riding at round<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ups. No matter how unimportant a job given			
<lb/>to a <q>brave</q>, he moved upon the place the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lowing day with all of his relatives far and			
<lb/>near, and until the job was done, O Bar O			
<lb/>would take on the aspect of an Indian en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>campment. At such times Hilda, who knew</p>

            <p>personally most of the Indians of the Stoney			
<lb/>tribe, would ride over to the camp daily to call			
<lb/>upon the squaws, her saddle bags full of the			
<lb/>sweet food the Indians so loved. She was			
<lb/>idolized by the Indian women. When riding			
<lb/>gauntlets and breeks were to be made for the			
<lb/>daughter of P. D. only the softest of hides			
<lb/>were used and upon them the squaws lavished			
<lb/>their choicest of bead work. They were for			
<lb/><q>Miss Hildy, the Indian’s friend</q>. Of all the			
<lb/>squaws, Hilda loved best Jessie Three-Young<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>Mans; but Jessie had recently fallen into deep			
<lb/>trouble. Like her tiny papoose, the Indian			
<lb/>girl’s face had that faraway longing look of			
<lb/>one destined to leave this life ere long. She			
<lb/>who had strayed from her own people clung			
<lb/>the closer to them now when she was so soon to			
<lb/>leave them forever. Hilda alone of the white			
<lb/>people, the Indian girl crept forth from her			
<lb/>tent to greet. What she refused to tell even			
<lb/>her parents, Jessie revealed to Hilda McPher<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>son and accordingly Hilda loathed Holy			
<lb/>Smoke.</p>

<lb/>ranch, for there were times when Bully Bill			
<lb/>went to the camps to oversee certain opera<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tions and in his absence Ho had charge of the			
<lb/>ranch and its stock. Also in P. D.’s absence,			
<lb/>Hilda was accustomed to take her father’s

<lb/>if there were any questions that needed re<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>Thus she was forced to come into contact with

            <p>Ho had what Hilda considered a <q>disgust<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>his conversation when he came to the house			
<lb/>on matters connected with the cattle, and no

<lb/>spruced himself up for those calls at the ranch<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>at his neck, Ho set out to make a <q>hit</q> with his			
<lb/>employer’s daughter.</p>
            <p>At the time when Cheerio was reading from			
<lb/>Dumas, P. D. was away in Edmonton, and for			
<lb/>a few days Bully Bill had gone down to Cal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gary, accompanying his men with a load of			
<lb/>steers for the local market. Ho, therefore, in			
<lb/>the absence of both of the bosses, was in charge</p>
            <p>of the ranch, and one evening he presented			
<lb/>himself at the house, ostensibly to inquire re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>garding the disposition of certain yearlings			
<lb/>that had been shipped by Bully Bill from the			
<lb/>Calgary stockyards. Were they to be turned			
<lb/>on the range with the other stuff? Should he			
<lb/>keep them in separate fields? How about re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>branding the new stuff? Should he go ahead			
<lb/>or wait till the round-up of the O Bar O year<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lings and brand all at one time?</p>
            <p><q>Dad’s in Edmonton</q>, replied Hilda. <q>You			
<lb/>had better wait till he gets back, though I don’t			
<lb/>know just when that will be. He’s playing			
<lb/>chess</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Couldn’t you get him by phone or wire,			
<lb/>Miss Hilda? Rather important to know what</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[125 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>to do with this new stuff, seein’ as how they’re			
<lb/>pure-bred. Maybe the boss’!l want them spe<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cially cared for.</p>
            <p><q>I could phone, of course, for I know where			
<lb/>to get him, but it makes him mad as a hornet			
<lb/>to talk on the telephone, especially long dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tance, and as for a wire, like as not, if Dad’s			
<lb/>playing chess, he’d just chuck it into his pocket			
<lb/>and never bother to read it</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Wa-al, I just thought I’d come along over			
<lb/>and talk it out with you, Miss Hilda. Your			
<lb/>orders goes, you know, every time</q>.</p>
            <p>He helped himself to a seat, which the girl			
<lb/>had not proffered him, and stretched out his			
<lb/>long legs as if for a prolonged visit. Hilda			
<lb/>remained standing, looking down at him			
<lb/>coolly, then she quietly moved toward the			
<lb/>door, and opened it.</p>
            <p><q>That'll be all, then</q>, she said, and held			
<lb/>the screen door open.</p>
            <p>The cowhand, with a black look at the back			
<lb/>of the small, proud head, arose and taking the			
<lb/>hint he passed out. Hilda snapped the screen</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>door and hooked it. From outside, in a last			
<lb/>effort to detain her, Ho said:</p>
            <p><q>One minute, Miss Hilda. Did you say			
<lb/>them doegies were to go into the south pasture			
<lb/>with our own stuff, then?</q></p>
            <p>Hilda had not mentioned the south pasture.			
<lb/>However she said now:</p>
            <p><q>T suppose that will be all right, won’t it?</q></p>
            <p><q>Well, if they was mine I’d keep ’em in the			
<lb/>corrals for a bit, and give ’em the once-over in			
<lb/>case they’s any blackleg among ’em. They’s

            <p><q>All right, then. Keep them in the cor<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rals</q>,</p>
            <p>After all, the man knew his business, and			
<lb/>she looked at him curiously through the screen			
<lb/>door.</p>
            <p><q>Everything else on the place all right?			
<lb/>Nothing loose? I thought I saw some stuff			
<lb/>in the bull pasture when I rode up from the			
<lb/>Minnehaha ranch to-day</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Them doegies is all right, Miss Hilda.			
<lb/>There ain’t nothin’ out ’cept what’s meant to

<lb/>take it from me.</p>
            <p><q>T didn’t mean to question that</q>, she said			
<lb/>quickly.</p>
            <p>Her father’s sense of squareness in treat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment of his men was shared by her, and she			
<lb/>added with a slightly more friendly tone:</p>
            <p><q>You know an awful lot about cattle, don’t			
<lb/>you, Hoe</q></p>
            <p>To give Ho <q>an inch</q> was to yield the			
<lb/>proverbial mile. Instantly he was grinning			
<lb/>back at her, his chest swelling with conceit			
<lb/>and self-esteem, as he pressed against the			
<lb/>screen door, his bold eyes seeking hers.</p>
            <p><q>T know "bout everything they is to know

            <p>He leered and chuckled. The conversation

            <p>Hilda’s scorn had turned to anger. Holy			
<lb/>Smoke’s body was against the screen door,			
<lb/>bulging the wirework in. His cunning gaze			
<lb/>never left her face. He had lowered his voice			
<lb/>meaningly.</p>
            <p><q>How about that English fly, Miss? He’s			
<lb/>getting fair handy with the lariat, they do

            <p>Hilda had flushed scarlet and drawn back</p>

<lb/>hand on the outer side of the door stopped			
<lb/>her in her premeditated flight and sent a cold			
<lb/>shiver all over her.</p>
            <p><q>Ye needn’t to worry "bout him, Miss Hilda.			
<lb/>He ain’t likely to swing his lariat in your

            <p>Hilda’s dry lips, against her will, moved in			
<lb/>burning query:</p>
            <p><q>Who do you mean?</q></p>
            <p>She scarcely knew her own voice. Some<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thing wild and primitive was surging through			
<lb/>her being: She wanted to cry out, to hurl			
<lb/>something into the face of the grinning man

<lb/>stayed for an answer:</p>
            <p><q>Her that’s under his pillow. Her that he

            <p>For some time, oblivious to the taunts and			
<lb/>jeers cast at him, Cheerio, returned from the			
<lb/>round-up, had been standing by his horse’s			
<lb/>head gazing up the hill in a brown study of			
<lb/>rapture. The sight of that army sweeping in			
<lb/>from all directions over the hills and from the			
<lb/>woods, to meet in the lower pastures and auto<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>matically form in to that symmetrical file, fas<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cinated him beyond words. Even the riders,			
<lb/>loosely seated on their horses, their bright			
<lb/>handkerchiefs blowing free in the breeze,			
<lb/>whirling lariat and long cattle whips, flanking			
<lb/>and following the herd, seemed pleasing ‘to			
<lb/>the eye of the Englishman.</p>
            <p>Though the day of the chap-clad, large<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>hatted type of cowboy is said to have passed			
<lb/>in the Western States, in Alberta he is still a	<!--Alberta as an odd, or perhaps skewed, mimesis of the cowboy mythos-->

            <p>mantic element about them which has made			
<lb/>the cowboy famous in story and in song. He			
<lb/>wears the fur and leather chaps, the buckskin			
<lb/>shirts and coats, the Indian beaded gauntlets			
<lb/>and the wide felt hats not wholly because they			
<lb/>are good to look at, but because of their sterl<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing qualities for utilitarian purposes. The			
<lb/>chaps are indispensable for the trail, the fur			
<lb/>ones for warmth and general protection and			
<lb/>the leather ones for the brush. The great			
<lb/>hats, which the Indians also use in Alberta,			
<lb/>serve the double purposes of protection from			
<lb/>a too-ardent sun and as great drinking vessels			
<lb/>during a long ride. The hide shirts are both			
<lb/>wind and sun proof and the beadwork sewn			
<lb/>on with gut thread serve as excellent places			
<lb/>for the scratching of matches. Cheerio him<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>self had by now a full cowboy outfit, chaps,			
<lb/>hide shirt, wide hat, flowing tie, but he never			
<lb/>tired of looking appreciatively at the other fel<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lows in similar garb. Now, with eyes slightly			
<lb/>screwed to get the right angle upon them, he			
<lb/>planned a canvas that was some day to hang in			
<lb/>a place of great honour.</p>

            <p>The morning’s work had been exhilarating.			
<lb/>To him had been assigned some of the most			
<lb/>difficult riding tasks of the round-up. He had			
<lb/>been dispatched into the bush on the east side			
<lb/>of the Ghost River to gather in forty-seven			
<lb/>strays that had taken refuge in the bog lands			
<lb/>and had drawn with them their young into this			
<lb/>insecure and dubious protection from the			
<lb/>riders.</p>
            <p>Cheerio had ridden through woods so dense			
<lb/>that his horse could barely squeeze between			
<lb/>the bushes and the trees. He had been obliged			
<lb/>to draw his feet out of the stirrups and ride			
<lb/>cross-legged in his saddle. Sometimes he was			
<lb/>forced to dismount and lead his horse over			
<lb/>trails so narrow that the animal had balked			
<lb/>and hesitated to pass until led. Rattling a			
<lb/>tin bell made of an empty tomato can with a			
<lb/>couple of rocks in it, Cheerio wended his way			
<lb/>through the deep woods. This loudly-clank<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing contraption served to rouse and frighten			
<lb/>the hidden cattle out into the open, but several			
<lb/>of them retreated and plunged farther into the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[135]</fw>
            <pb n="136"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>bush that bordered hidden pools of succulent			
<lb/>mud and quicksand.</p>
            <p>The branches of the thick trees had snapped			
<lb/>against his face as he rode and his chin and			
<lb/>cheeks were scratched where the wide hat had			
<lb/>failed to afford sufficient protection. The			
<lb/>sleeves of his rough riding shirt were literally			
<lb/>torn to shreds and even the bright magenta			
<lb/>chaps that were his especial pride and care			
<lb/>came out of that brush ragged, soiled and full			
<lb/>of dead leaves, brush and mud.</p>
            <p>He had been delayed at a slough whose sur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>face of dark green growth gave no intimation			
<lb/>of the muddy quicksands beneath. Stuck hard			
<lb/>in the mud of this pool a terrified heifer was			
<lb/>slowly sinking, while her bawling calf was			
<lb/>restrained from following its mother only			
<lb/>through the quick action of Cheerio, who			
<lb/>drove the distracted little creature a consider<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able distance into the woods ere he returned to			
<lb/>its mother.</p>
            <p>It is one thing to throw the lariat in an open			
<lb/>space and to land it upon the horns or the back			
<lb/>feet of a fleeing animal. It is another</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 136 ]</fw>
            <pb n="137"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>thing to swing a lariat in a thickly-wooded			
<lb/>bush where the noose is more likely than not			
<lb/>to land securely in the branch or the crotch of			
<lb/>a tree, resisting all tugs and jerks to leave its			
<lb/>secure hold. Cheerio, inexpert with the lariat,			
<lb/>gave up all thought of rescuing the animal in			
<lb/>that way. Instead, his quick wits worked to			
<lb/>devise a more ingenious method of pulling the			
<lb/>heifer from the slough, where she would have			
<lb/>perished without help.</p>
            <p>Along the edges of the woods were fallen			
<lb/>willow trees and bushes that the Indians had			
<lb/>cleaved for future fence posts. Cheerio			
<lb/>hauled a quantity of these over to the slough,			
<lb/>and shoving and piling them in criss-cross sec<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tions, he made a sort of ford to within about			
<lb/>fifteen feet of the mired cow. His horse was			
<lb/>tied by its halter rope to a tree. With one end			
<lb/>of the lariat firmly attached to the pommel of			
<lb/>his saddle which had been cinched on to the			
<lb/>animal very tightly and the other end about			
<lb/>his own waist, Cheerio crossed this ford to<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward the animal. He now let out the lariat			
<lb/>and coiled its end for the toss. It landed easily</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 137]</fw>
            <pb n="138"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>upon the horns of the animal. Holding to the			
<lb/>rope, now drawn taut, Cheerio made his way			
<lb/>back over the ford. Unfastening his horse, he			
<lb/>mounted. Now began the hard part of the			
<lb/>work. His horse rode out a few feet and the			
<lb/>sudden pull upon the horns of the cow brought			
<lb/>her to her feet. She stumbled and swayed but			
<lb/>the rope held her up. A pause for rest for			
<lb/>horse and heifer, and then another and harder			
<lb/>and longer pull and tug. The cow, half<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>strangled in the mud, nevertheless was drawn			
<lb/>along by the stout lariat rope. She slid along			
<lb/>the slippery floor of the slough and not till her			
<lb/>feet touched sod was she able to give even a			
<lb/>feeble aid to the now heavily-panting mare.</p>
            <p>Once on solid ground, Cheerio burst into a			
<lb/>cheer such as an excited boy might have given,			
<lb/>and he called soothingly to the desperately<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>frightened heifer.</p>
            <p><q>You're doing fine, old girl! There you go!			
<lb/>Ripping!</q> And to the mare:</p>
            <p><q>Good for you, Sally-Ann! You’re a top<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>notcher, old girl!</q></p>
            <p>There was an interval to give the exhausted</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 138 ]</fw>
            <pb n="139"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>animals an opportunity for a rest and then			
<lb/>they were on the bush trail again, the heifer			
<lb/>going slowly ahead, thoroughly tamed and de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>jected, yet rasing her head with monotonous			
<lb/>regularity to call and moan her long loud cry			
<lb/>for her young.</p>
            <p>As Cheerio came out into the open range			
<lb/>certain words recurred to his mind and he re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>peated them aloud with elation and pride:</p>
            <p><q>They’s the makings of a damn fine cowboy			
<lb/>in you</q>, had said the foreman of O Bar O.</p>
            <p>He was whooping and hurrahing internally			
<lb/>for himself and he felt as proud of his achieve<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment as if he had won a hard pitched battle.			
<lb/>In fact, if one reckoned success in the terms			
<lb/>of dollars and of cents, then Cheerio had			
<lb/>saved for O Bar O the considerable sum of			
<lb/>$1500, which was the value of the pure-bred			
<lb/>heifer rescued from the slough. Moreover,			
<lb/>Cheerio had brought from the bush the full			
<lb/>quota of missing cows and their offspring.			
<lb/>When at last he joined up with that steadily<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>growing line pouring down from all parts of			
<lb/>the woods and the ranges, to join in the lower</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 139]</fw>

            <p>meadows, he was whistling and jubilantly			
<lb/>keeping time to his music with the clanking			
<lb/><q>bell</q>, and when he came within sight of his			
<lb/><q>mates</q> he waved his hat above his head, and			
<lb/>rode gleefully down among them, shouting			
<lb/>and boasting of his day’s work. He counted			
<lb/>his cows with triumph before the doubting			
<lb/><q>Thomases</q> who had predicted that the ten<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>derfoot would come out of that dense wood			
<lb/>with half a heifer’s horn and a calf’s foot.</p>
            <p>They rode westward under a sky bright			
<lb/>blue, while facing them, wrapped about in a			
<lb/>haze of soft mauve, the snow-crowned peaks			
<lb/>of the Rocky Mountains towered before them			
<lb/>like adream. The glow of a late summer day			
<lb/>was tinting all of the horizon and rested in			
<lb/>slumberous splendour upon the widespreading			
<lb/>bosom of pastures and meadows and fair un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dulating sloping hills. Almost in silence, as			
<lb/>if unconsciously subdued by the beauty of the			
<lb/>day, came the O Bar O outfit, riding ahead,			
<lb/>behind, and flanking the two sides of that mar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vellous army of cattle.</p>

            <p>Small wonder that the Englishman’s heart			
<lb/>beat high and that his blood seemed to race in			
<lb/>his veins with an electrical fervour that comes			
<lb/>from sheer joy and satisfaction with life. If			
<lb/>anyone had asked him whether he regretted			
<lb/>the life he had deliberately sacrificed for this			
<lb/>wild <q>adventure</q> in Western Canada, he			
<lb/>would have shouted with all the vehemence			
<lb/>and it may be some of the typical profanity of			
<lb/>O Bar O:</p>
            <p><q>Not by a blistering pipeful! This is the			
<lb/>life! It’s r-ripping! It’s—Jake!</q></p>
            <p>But now they were at the corrals. Finished			
<lb/>the exhilarating riding of the range, done the			
<lb/>pretty work of cutting out the cattle and draw<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing the herd into that line while one by one

<lb/>while the calves that were to be operated upon			
<lb/>were <q>cut out</q> and driven into the corrals.</p>
            <p>Slowly Cheerio tore his gaze from the fas<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cinating spectacle of that moving stream of			
<lb/>cattle and turned towards the corral. He saw,			
<lb/>first of all, a giant structure, a platform on</p>

            <pb n="142"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>which was a gallowslike contrivance. Already			
<lb/>a bawling calf had been driven up the incline			
<lb/>and its head had been gripped by the closing			
<lb/>gates around itsneck. The Squeezegate! The			
<lb/>dehorning shears were being sharpened over			
<lb/>the grindstone and the whirring of the wheel,			
<lb/>the grating of the steel hissed into the moaning			
<lb/>cries of the trapped calves in the corrals.</p>

<lb/><q>vet</q>. The latter glimpsed him over in one			
<lb/>unflattering and comprehensive sweep of a			
<lb/>pair of keen black eyes. Then, through the			
<lb/>corner of his mouth, he hailed young Sandy,			
<lb/>right on the job at the fire.</p>
            <p><q>Hey, kid, give a poke, will yer? Keep that			
<lb/>fire agoing</q>.</p>
            <p>This was a job upon which Sandy doted.			
<lb/>From his baby years, fire had been both his			
<lb/>joy and his bane, for despite many threats and			
<lb/>whippings, the burning down of a costly barn			
<lb/>brought a drastic punishment that was to stick			
<lb/>hotly in the memory of even a boy who loved			
<lb/>fire as dearly as did Sandy. It caused him			
<lb/>forevermore to regard matches with respect			
<lb/>and an element of fear. P. D. had deliberately			
<lb/>burned the tips of his son’s fingers. Though			
<lb/>Sandy feared the fire, he still loved it. With			
<lb/>both care and craft, therefore, he poked the			
<lb/>fire, and pounded the huge pieces of coal till

            <p>rals and the riders by the gates were cutting			
<lb/>out such of the mothers as had gotten through,			
<lb/>besides certain weaklings of the herd that were			
<lb/>to be spared the branding. These, temporarily			
<lb/>driven to adjoining corrals, set up the most			
<lb/>deafening outcries and calls for their young,			
<lb/>while in the calf corrals these sturdy young			
<lb/>creatures voiced their indignant and anguished

            <p>Darting in and out of the clamouring herd,

            <p>The scorching crunch of the closing</p>
            <p>Squeezegate and the first long bawl of agony			
<lb/>swept the pink from the cheeks of the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lishman. He was seized with a sudden, over<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>whelming impulse to flee from this Place of			
<lb/>Horrors, but as he turned instinctively toward			
<lb/>the gate, he saw Hilda standing upon it. She			
<lb/>had climbed to the third rung and, hands hold<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing lightly to the top rail, she watched the			
<lb/>operations with professional curiosity. For a			
<lb/>moment, Cheerio suffered a pang of revolting</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[145 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>repugnance. That one so young and so lovely			
<lb/>should be thus callous to suffering seemed to			
<lb/>him an inexcusable blemish.</p>
            <p>It may be that Hilda sensed something of			
<lb/>his judgment of her, for there was a pro<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nounced lifting of that dangerous young chin			
<lb/>and the free toss of the head so characteristic			
<lb/>of her wild nature, while her dark eyes shone			
<lb/>defiantly. Almost unconsciously, he found			
<lb/>himself excusing her. She had been born to			
<lb/>this life. Since her baby years she had been			
<lb/>freely among cattle and horses and men.			
<lb/>Daughter of a cattleman, Hilda knew that the			
<lb/>most painful of the operations, namely, the de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>horning, was, in a measure, a merciful thing			
<lb/>for the cattle, who might otherwise gore each			
<lb/>other to death. The vaccination was but a pin			
<lb/>prick, an assurance against the deadly black<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>leg. As for the branding, it was not nearly as			
<lb/>painful as was generally supposed, and first			
<lb/>aid was immediately administered to relieve			
<lb/>the pang of the burning. It was the only			
<lb/>means the cattlemen had for the identification			
<lb/>of their property. She resented, therefore,</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the horror and reproach which she sensed in			
<lb/>the stern gaze of the Englishman. Her cool,			
<lb/>level glance swept his white, accusing face.			
<lb/><q>Pretty sight, isn’t it?</q> she taunted. <q>If			
<lb/>* she went on, defi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>antly, </q><q>it is to see a brand slapped on true!</q>			
<lb/>With a nonchalant wisp of a smile, her toss-</p>
            <p>ing head indicated the stake, to which a three-</p>
            <p>there’s one thing I love,’</p>
            <p>month-old calf was bound, its head upturned			
<lb/>as the red-hot branding iron smote with a firm,			
<lb/>quick shot upon its left side.</p>
            <p>The odour of burnt hide nauseated Cheerio.			
<lb/>He felt the blood deserting his face and lips.			
<lb/>His knees and hands had a curiously numb			
<lb/>sensation. He was dizzy and almost blind.			
<lb/>He found himself holding to the gate rail,			
<lb/>the critical, judging glance of the girl fixed in			
<lb/>question upon his face.</p>
            <p>Like one hypnotized, he forced his gaze to<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward the branded calf and he saw something			
<lb/>then that brought his trembling hand out in a			
<lb/>gesture of almost entreaty and pain. A long,			
<lb/>red spurt of blood was trickling down the ani<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>Cheerio no longer saw the girl beside him,

<lb/>the impulse to cry out to her, to explain that			
<lb/>which had been incomprehensible to his com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rades in France.</p>
            <p>Hilda’s voice seemed to come from very far			
<lb/>away and the tumult that made up the bawling			
<lb/>voices of Holy Smoke and the raging hands of			
<lb/>the O Bar O was utterly unintelligible to him;			
<lb/>nor could he comprehend that the shouts were			
<lb/>directed at him. In a way, the shouting			
<lb/>brought him stark back to another scene, when,			
<lb/>in wrath, men seemed to rush over him and

            <p>ing with skill a long lariat that never failed			
<lb/>to land upon the horns of the desired calf and			
<lb/>bring it to the stake, urged all hands along			
<lb/>with profane and impure language. Auto<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>matically and with perfect precision, Hoot<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mon was clapping the brand upon one calf			
<lb/>after another and passing them along to the			
<lb/><q>Vet</q>, who in turn thrust the syringe into the			
<lb/>thigh, the prick of the vaccination being			
<lb/>dulled in comparison with the fiercer pang			
<lb/>of the branding iron. Now the rope had

<lb/>pause.</p>

<lb/>this way! For the love of Saint Peter!</q></p>
            <p>At the other end of the rope that Sandy			
<lb/>had thrust into his hands, a three-month-old			
<lb/>calf pulled and fought for freedom. From its			
<lb/>head, where the dehorning shears had already			
<lb/>performed their work a dark sickening stream			
<lb/>dripped. Sandy had twisted the rope partly			
<lb/>around the post but it still remained un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>knotted.</p>
            <p>Someone was calling something across the</p>

            <p>corral, Cheerio found himself going around			
<lb/>and around the post. Suddenly a wild baw] of			
<lb/>anguish from the tortured animal sent him			
<lb/>staggering back and at the same moment the			
<lb/>calf seemed to plunge against him and the hot			
<lb/>blood spurted against his face.</p>
            <p>At that moment he clearly heard again the			
<lb/>crisp whipping words of his captain, scorch<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing his soul with its bitter ring of hatred and			
<lb/>scorn. The rope slipped from his hand. He			
<lb/>threw up his arm blindly, shrinking back.			
<lb/>His breath caught in the old craven sob.			
<lb/>Down into deep depths of space he sank,			
<lb/>sickened.</p>
            <p>Hilda McPherson had leaped down from			
<lb/>the rail and with an inarticulate cry, she gath<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ered Cheerio’s head into her arms. It was the			
<lb/>coarse sneering voice of Holy Smoke that re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>called her and forced her to see that shining			
<lb/>thing that was pinned to the breast of the un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>conscious man.</p>
            <p><q>Wearin’ her over his heart, huh!</q> chuckled			
<lb/>Ho, one thick, dirty finger upon the locket,			
<lb/>while his knowing glance pinned the stricken</p>

            <p>one of the girl. With a sob, Hilda drew back,			
<lb/>and came slowly to her feet, her eyes still look-</p>
            <p>ing down at the unconscious face with an ele<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment of both terror and anguish.</p>
            <p>He returned with a cry—a startling cry of			
<lb/>blended agony and fear, for the odour of blood			
<lb/>was still in his nostrils and all about him was			
<lb/>the tumult of the battlefield; but all that Hilda			
<lb/>noted was that his first motion was that grasp			
<lb/>at his breast. His hand closed above the			
<lb/>locket. He sat up unsteadily, dazedly. He			
<lb/>even made an effort now to smile.</p>
            <p><q>That’s f-funny. Carn’t stand the blood.			
<lb/>M-makes me f-funky. C-c-constitutional—</q>			
<lb/>His words dribbled off.</p>
            <p>Hilda said nothing. She continued to stare			
<lb/>down at him, but her face had hardened.</p>
            <p><q>What t’ ’ell’s the matter?</q> snarled Ho.			
<lb/><q>Ain’t yer fit to stand the gaff of a bit of			
<lb/>brandin’ even?</q></p>
            <p>The girl’s averted face gave him no encour<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>slipping deeper and deeper into the mire of			
<lb/>disgrace.</p>

            <p>Ho, hand cupped at the back of his ear, was			
<lb/>drinking in every word of the broken confes<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sion, while his delighted eyes exchanged			
<lb/>glances with the girl. Her chin had gone to			
<lb/>a high level. Without looking at Cheerio, she			
<lb/>said:</p>
            <p><q>Say no more. We have your number</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Better get to the bunkhouse</q>, said Ho.			
<lb/><q>This ain’t no place for a minister’s son</q>.</p>
            <p>Cheerio managed somehow to come to his			
<lb/>feet. He still felt fearfully weak and the per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sisting odour of blood and burnt hide made			
<lb/>him sick beyond endurance. Limping to the			
<lb/>gate, he paused a moment to say to the girl,			
<lb/>with a pathetic attempt at lightness of speech:</p>
            <p><q>Fraid I’m not cut out for cowboy life.			
<lb/>I'd j-jolly well like to learn the g-game. I			
<lb/>d-don’t seem exactly to fit</q>.</p>
            <p>She was leaning against the corral gate.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 153]</fw>
            <pb n="154"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Her face was turned away, and the averted			
<lb/>cheek was scarlet. He felt the blaze of her			
<lb/>scornful eyes and suffered an exquisite pang of			
<lb/>longing to see them again as sometimes, after			
<lb/>the readings in the evening, humid and wide,			
<lb/>they had looked back at him in the twilight.			
<lb/><q>No, you don’t fit,’ she said slowly. </q><q>It			
<lb/>takes a man with guts to stand our life—a dead</q></p>
            <p>game sport, and not—not »</p>
            <p>She left the sentence unfinished, leaving the			
<lb/>epithet to his imagination. She turned her			
<lb/>back upon him. He limped tothe house. For			
<lb/>a long time he sat on the steps, his head in his			
<lb/>hands.</p>
            <p>Slowly there grew into his consciousness an<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>other scene. He had come to suddenly out of			
<lb/>just such a moment of unconsciousness as that			
<lb/>he had suffered at the corral. Then there had			
<lb/>flooded over him such an overpowering con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sciousness of what had befallen him that he			
<lb/>had staggered, with a shout, to his feet. At the			
<lb/>psychological moment, when his company had			
<lb/>started forward, he had welched, stumbled</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[154 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>back, and, with the anguished oaths of the cap<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tain he loved ringing in his ears, Cheerio had			
<lb/>gone down into darkness. He had come to			
<lb/>as one in a resurrection, born anew, and in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vigorated with a passionate resolve to compen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sate with his life for that error, that moment			
<lb/>of weakness.</p>
            <p>There was an objective to be taken at any			
<lb/>cost. The men had gone on. He found him<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>self crawling across No Man’s Land. But a			
<lb/>hundred feet away he came to his company.			
<lb/>Upon the ground they lay, like a bunch of			
<lb/>sheep without a leader. There was not an			
<lb/>officer left, save that one who had been his			
<lb/>friend and who had cursed him for a renegade			
<lb/>when he turned back. Fearfully wounded, his			
<lb/>captain was slowly pulling his way along the			
<lb/>ground, painfully worming toward that clump			
<lb/>of wood from which the sporadic bursts of			
<lb/>gun fire were coming. Cheerio understood.			
<lb/>Someone had to put that machine-gun out of			
<lb/>commission or they would all be annihilated.			
<lb/>He was crawling side by side with his captain,			
<lb/>begging him to turn back and to trust him to</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[155]</fw>
            <pb n="156"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>take his place. He was pleading, arguing,			
<lb/>threatening and forcing the wounded man			
<lb/>down into a shell-hole where he could not			
<lb/>move. Now he was on his own job.</p>
            <p>Alone, within forty or fifty yards of the ma<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>chine-gun, he paused, to take stock of what he			
<lb/>had in the way of ammunition with him. He			
<lb/>found he had a single smoke bomb and re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>solved to use it. Getting into a shell-hole, he			
<lb/>unslung his rifle and placed the bomb into it			
<lb/>and prepared it for firing. He waited for the			
<lb/>right wind to shift the smoke and then care<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fully fired the gun.</p>
            <p>By some remarkable stroke of fortune, it			
<lb/>fell and exploded in such a position that the			
<lb/>wind carried the smoke in a heavy cloud im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mediately over the German machine-gun post,			
<lb/>rendering the operators of the machine abso<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lutely powerless. At that moment Cheerio			
<lb/>leaped from the shell-hole, and rushing for<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward, pulled a pin from a Mills bomb, as he			
<lb/>ran. When about twenty yards away, he threw			
<lb/>the bomb into the smoke and fell to the ground</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 156 ]</fw>
            <pb n="157"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>to await the explosion. It came with a terrific			
<lb/>crash, fragments of the bomb bursting over<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>head. ‘Jumping up and grasping his rifle			
<lb/>firmly, he plunged into the smoke which had			
<lb/>not yet cleared. Suddenly he fell into a			
<lb/>trench, and he could not restrain a cheer to			
<lb/>find that the machine-gun was lying on its side.			
<lb/>It was out of action.</p>
            <p>There was no time to survey the situation,			
<lb/>for two of the enemy had rushed toward him			
<lb/>swinging their <q>potato mashers</q> as the British			
<lb/>soldiers were wont to call this type of bomb.			
<lb/>Now that he realized that he had accom<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>plished his objective, his elation had turned			
<lb/>to the old sickening feeling of terror, as he			
<lb/>watched one of the Germans pull the little			
<lb/>white knob and throw the grenade. It missed			
<lb/>him and struck the parapet of the trench.			
<lb/>About to rush him, the Germans were re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>strained by an officer who had come up un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>observed until then. He would take the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>desired to put to him. Yelling: <q>Komm

            <p>prods of the bayonet, Cheerio went before the			
<lb/>Germans.</p>
            <p>His hands swept his face as if by their mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>so Clearly to memory. No! Not even the girl			
<lb/>he loved—for in his misery, Cheerio faced the

            <p>On November thirtieth—scarce two months			
<lb/>off—he, P. D. McPherson, chess champion			
<lb/>of Western Canada, was to go to the City of

            <p>this was evidence of an amazing racial pro<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vincialism that P. D. proposed to expose and			
<lb/>damn forevermore.</p>
            <p><q>Hilda! Damn it all, where are your</q></p>

            <p>No reply. It was evident that the house			
<lb/>was empty and his son and daughter nowhere			
<lb/>within hearing unless in hiding. Chum Lee			
<lb/>scurried past back from the corrals, and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>that pursued him from his <q>bossie</q>.</p>
            <p>From the direction of the corrals a din

            <p>These cries were not music to the ears of the			
<lb/>formerly proud owner of the cattle. It mat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tered not this day to P. D. whether a brand			
<lb/>was slapped on true or banged on upside down;			
<lb/>whether it were blurred or distinct. It mat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tered not whether the dehorning shears had			
<lb/>snipped to one inch of the animal’s head as			
<lb/>prescribed by law, or had clipped down into			
<lb/>the skull itself. He paid a foreman cracka<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>jack wages to look after his cattle. If he			
<lb/>could not do the work properly, there were			
<lb/>other foremen to be had in Alberta. P. D.			
<lb/>had no desire whatsoever to go to the corrals			
<lb/>and witness the operations. His place at the			
<lb/>present time was the house, where one could			
<lb/>occupy their minds with the scientific game			
<lb/>of chess.</p>
            <p><q>Sandy! Sandy!</q></p>
            <p>Back into the house went the irate P. D.			
<lb/>The chess table was jerked out and the chess			
<lb/>board set up. P. D. propped up a book con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>taining illustrations of certain famous chess			
<lb/>games, before him, and set his men in place.</p>
            <p>P. D. began the game with a dummy part-</p>

            <p>ner, making his own move first and with pre<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cise care his partner’s. Fifteen minutes of chess			
<lb/>solitaire and then out again, and another and			
<lb/>louder calling for his son and his daughter.</p>
            <p>No doubt they were at the corrals, dog blast			
<lb/>their young fool souls. What was the matter			
<lb/>with that bleak nit-wit of a foreman? He was			
<lb/>hired to run a ranch, and given more men for			
<lb/>the job than that allotted by any other ranch			
<lb/>for a similar work. What in blue hades did			
<lb/>he mean by drawing upon the house for labor?			
<lb/>The son and daughter of P. D. McPherson			
<lb/>were not common ranch hands that every time			
<lb/>a bit of branding or rounding-up was done			
<lb/>they should be pulled out to assist with the			
<lb/>blanketty, blistering, hell-fire work.</p>
            <p>Raging up and down, up and down, through			
<lb/>the wide verandah and back through the halls			
<lb/>and into the living-room again and again at			
<lb/>the unsatisfactory chess solitaire, the furious			
<lb/>old rancher was in a black mood when voices			
<lb/>outside the verandah caused him to jerk his			
<lb/>chin forward at attention. The missing mis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>creants had returned!</p>

            <p><q>SAN-NDY!</q></p>
            <p>The three on the verandah jumped. That			
<lb/>crisp summons, that peculiar inflection meant			
<lb/>but one thing. Chess! Sandy cast a swift			
<lb/>agonized glance about him, seeking an imme<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>diate mode of escape. He was slipping cat<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>footed and doubled over along the back of the			
<lb/>swinging couch on the verandah, when again			
<lb/>came the imperative summons, this time with			
<lb/>even more deadly significance.</p>
            <p><q>Sandy! In here, sir!</q></p>
            <p><q>Yessir, I’m comin’, sir</q>.</p>
            <p>Now it happened that the foreman of O			
<lb/>Bar O had come especially over to the ranch			
<lb/>house, accompanied by the son and daughter			
<lb/>of P. D. to announce to his employer the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>charge of Cheerio. It was an ironclad rule of

<lb/>ined before the final court of judgment in the</p>

            <p>person of P. D. This was merely a formal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ity, for P. D. was accustomed to O. K. the			
<lb/>acts of his foreman. Nevertheless, it was one			
<lb/>of the customs that could not be ignored.			
<lb/>What is more, a man reported for his final			
<lb/>pay to the supreme boss of the ranch.</p>
            <p>It was also the law at O Bar O that such			
<lb/>discharges and reports should be made after			
<lb/>the working hours in the field. In the present			
<lb/>instance, Bully Bill had harkened to the ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vice of his assistant and discharged Cheerio			
<lb/>at the noon hour. O Bar O, he contended,			
<lb/>could not afford to risk its prestige by having			
<lb/>in its employ for even a few more hours a man			
<lb/>who had acted at the corrals as had the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lishman. Therefore, having put his men back			
<lb/>to work at the corrals, Bully Bill had come			
<lb/>to the house to report to his employer.</p>
            <p>That Sandy summons was unmistakable.			
<lb/>The noble and ancient game was about to be			
<lb/>played. It was well-known lese majeste to			
<lb/>interrupt when the game was in progress.			
<lb/>Bully Bill and the young McPhersons looked			
<lb/>at each other in consternation and dismay.</p>

            <pb n="171"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Sandy, in his ragged and soiled overalls,			
<lb/>one of the <q>galluses</q> missing and the other			
<lb/>hitched in place with a safety pin, groaned			
<lb/>aloud, then shuffled unwillingly into the house.			
<lb/>Rebellion bristled and stuck out of every inch			
<lb/>of the reluctant and disgusted boy. At that			
<lb/>moment Sandy loathed chess above everything			
<lb/>else on earth. It was a damfool game that			
<lb/>no other boy in the country was forced to			
<lb/>play. Sandy could not see why he should be			
<lb/>singled out as a special victim. Sullenly he			
<lb/>seated himself before the hated board. Blindly			
<lb/>he lifted and moved a black pawn forward			
<lb/>two paces. His father’s eyes snapped through			
<lb/>his glasses.</p>
            <p><q>Since when did it become the custom for			
<lb/>the Black to move before the White?</q> he			
<lb/>demanded fiercely.</p>
            <p>Sandy coughed and replaced the pawn. His			
<lb/>father took the first move with his white pawn.</p>
            <p>Now when Sandy McPherson entered thus			
<lb/>unwillingly into the ranch house he passed			
<lb/>not alone into the place. Close upon his heels,			
<lb/>silently and unseen by the absorbed master of</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the house, followed the yellow dog, Viper.			
<lb/>He slunk in fact along behind chairs and			
<lb/>tables, for well Viper knew he was on for<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>bidden and hostile territory. Reaching the			
<lb/>great, overstuffed sofa that stood in soft luxury			
<lb/>before the big stone fireplace, Viper leaped			
<lb/>soundlessly aboard, and a moment later was			
<lb/>snuggled well down among the numerous sofa			
<lb/>pillows and cushions that were the creations			
<lb/>of Hilda’s feminine hands.</p>
            <p>P. D. McPherson had his scientific opinion			
<lb/>touching upon the subject of dogs. To a lim<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ited extent, he had experimented upon the			
<lb/>canine race, but he had not given the subject			
<lb/>the thought or the work bestowed on his other			
<lb/>subjects, as he considered animals of this sort			
<lb/>were placed on earth more for the purpose			
<lb/>of ornament and companionship rather than			
<lb/>for utilization by the human race, as in the			
<lb/>case of horses, cattle, pigs, etc. O Bar O pos<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sessed some excellent examples of P. D.’s ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>periments. He had produced some quite re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>markable cattle dogs, a cross between collie			
<lb/>and coyote in looks and trained so that they</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 172 ]</fw>
            <pb n="173"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>were almost as efficient in the work of cutting			
<lb/>out and rounding-up cattle as the cowboys.			
<lb/>These dogs had been duly exhibited at the			
<lb/>Calgary Fair but the judgment upon them			
<lb/>had so aroused the wrath of the indignant P. D.			
<lb/>that after a speech that became almost a classic			
<lb/>in its way, because of the variety and quality			
<lb/>of its extraordinary words, P. D. departed			
<lb/>from the fair ground with his <q>thoroughbred			
<lb/>mongrels</q> as the <q>blank, blank, blank fool			
<lb/>judges</q> had joshingly named them. P. D. was			
<lb/>not finished with his dog experiments <q>‘by a			
<lb/>damn sight</q>. However, his subjects at this			
<lb/>time were held in excellent quarters pending			
<lb/>the time when P. D. would renew work upon			
<lb/>them. Occasionally, said dogs were brought			
<lb/>forth for the inspection of their creator, but			
<lb/>even they, good products and even servants			
<lb/>of O Bar O, knew better than to intrude into			
<lb/>his private residences.</p>
            <p>Of Viper’s existence at the present stage in			
<lb/>his career, P. D. was totally ignorant. He			
<lb/>supposed, in fact, that this miserable little			
<lb/>specimen of the mongrel race had been duly</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 173 ]</fw>
            <pb n="174"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>executed, for such had been his stern orders,			
<lb/>when at an inconvenient time Viper had first</p>
            <p>thrust himself upon the notice of his master’s			
<lb/>father.</p>
            <p>P. D. knew not that such execution was			
<lb/>stayed through the weakness of the execu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tioner, who had hearkened to the heartrend<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing pleas for clemency and mercy that had			
<lb/>poured in a torrent from Sandy, supported by			
<lb/>the pitying Hilda. Sandy had pledged him<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>self moreover to see that his dog was kept out			
<lb/>of sight and sound of his parent.</p>
            <p>Of all his possessions, Sandy valued Viper			
<lb/>the most. Ever since the day when he had			
<lb/>traded a whole sack of purloined sugar for			
<lb/>the ugly little yellow puppy, Sandy had loved			
<lb/>his dog. He had <q>raised</q> him <q>by hand</q>,			
<lb/>in the beginning actually wrapping the puppy			
<lb/>up in a towel and forcing him to suckle from			
<lb/>a baby bottle acquired at the trading-post			
<lb/>especially for that purpose. All that that dog			
<lb/>was or would be, he owed to Sandy McPher<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>son. Sandy considered him <q>a perfect gen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tleman</q> in many ways, one who could <q>put</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 174]</fw>
            <pb n="175"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>it all over those pampered kennel fellows.			
<lb/>Viper could bark <q>Thank you</q> for a bone as			
<lb/>intelligibly as if he had uttered the words; he			
<lb/>could wipe his mouth, blow his nose, suppress			
<lb/>a yawn with an uplifted paw, and weep feel<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ingly. He could dance a jig, turn somersaults,			
<lb/>balance a ball on his nose, and he could laugh			
<lb/>as realistically as a hyena. Not only was he			
<lb/>possessed of these valuable talents, but Viper			
<lb/>had demonstrated his value by services to the			
<lb/>ranch which only his master fully appreciated.			
<lb/>The barns, when Viper was at hand, were			
<lb/>kept free of cats and poultry and other stock			
<lb/>that had no right to be there, and Sandy’s			
<lb/>job of bringing home the milk cows in the			
<lb/>morning and evening was successfully trans<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ferred to Viper. Sandy had merely to say:			
<lb/><q>Gawn! Git ’em in</q>, and the little dog			
<lb/>would be off like a flash, through the barn<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>yard, out into the pasture, and up the hill to			
<lb/>where cattle were grazing. He would pick			
<lb/>out from among them the ten head of milk			
<lb/>stock, snap at their heels till they were formed</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[175 ]</fw>
            <pb n="176"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>into a separate bunch, and drive them down			
<lb/>to the milk sheds.</p>
            <p>Viper’s continued existence at O Bar O,			
<lb/>therefore, was most desired by his master. By			
<lb/>some miracle, due largely to P. D.’s absorp-</p>
            <p>tion in his own important affairs, the little			
<lb/>dog had escaped the notice or especial obser<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vation of Sandy’s father. Once he had indeed			
<lb/>looked absently at the dog as he passed at the			
<lb/>heels of Sandy, and he had actually remarked			
<lb/>at that time on the <q>Indian dogs</q> that were			
<lb/>about the place, and that should be kept			
<lb/>toward the camps.</p>
            <p>In the hurry and rush of events of this es<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pecial day, Viper was forgotten, and the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cited Sandy had omitted to lock him up in			
<lb/>the barn, as was his custom, when he went			
<lb/>to the house.</p>
            <p>So far as P. D. was concerned, Viper was			
<lb/>a dead dog. Very much alive in fact, how<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ever, was Sandy’s dog, as curled up on that			
<lb/>couch of luxury he bit and snapped at elusive			
<lb/>fleas that are no respectors of places and things			
<lb/>and thrive on a dog’s back whether he be lying</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 176 ]</fw>
            <pb n="177"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>upon a bed of straw or sand or, as in the pres<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ent instance, curled up on an overstuffed sofa.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, as Sandy made his unwilling			
<lb/>moves, and while Viper disappeared into the			
<lb/>land of oblivion through the medium of dog			
<lb/>sleep, a whispered council of war was held			
<lb/>on the front verandah.</p>
            <p><q>Go in and speak to him now. The game			
<lb/>may run on till midnight. You know Dad!			
<lb/>If, by any chance, Sandy puts up a good fight			
<lb/>and prolongs the game, he’ll have it to do			
<lb/>all over again and again until Dad beats him			
<lb/>hard, and if Sandy plays a poor game, then			
<lb/>he’ll be as sore no one’ll be able to go near			
<lb/>him and he’ll make me take his place. So			
<lb/>there you are. You may as well take the bull			
<lb/>by the horns right now, and hop to it</q>.</p>
            <p>The woman tempted and the man did fall.</p>
            <p>The foreman of O Bar O, endeavouring to			
<lb/>put firmness and resolution into his softened			
<lb/>step, took his courage into his hands and en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tered the forbidden presence of the chess			
<lb/>players. Hat in hand, nervously twisting it			
<lb/>about, tobacco shifted respectfully into one</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[177]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>cheek, this big, lanky gawk of a man cleared			
<lb/>his throat apologetically. Only a slight			
<lb/>twitch of one bushy eyebrow betrayed the fact			
<lb/>of P. D.’s irritated knowledge of the presence			
<lb/>of intruders.</p>
            <p><q>Dad!</q> Hilda’s voice trembled slightly.			
<lb/>She appreciated the gravity of interrupting			
<lb/>her father’s game, but Hilda was in that ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>alted mood of the hero who sacrifices his own			
<lb/>upon the altar of necessity and duty. What			
<lb/>had occurred at the corrals was a climax to			
<lb/>her own judgment and condemnation of the			
<lb/>prisoner before the bar.</p>
            <p>P. D. affected not to hear that <q>Dad!</q> On			
<lb/>the contrary, he elaborately raised his hand,			
<lb/>paused it over a knight, lifted the knight and			
<lb/>set it from a black to a red square. Dangerous			
<lb/>and violent consequences, Hilda knew, were			
<lb/>more than likely to follow should she persist.			
<lb/>A matter of life and death concerned not the			
<lb/>chess monomaniac when a game was in prog<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ress. Not till the old gambler could shout the			
<lb/>final:</p>
            <p><q>Check to your king, sir! Game!</q> should</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[178]</fw>

            <p>man, woman, child, or dog dare to address			
<lb/>the players.</p>
            <p><q>Dad!</q></p>
            <p>P. D.’s hand, which had just left the afore<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mentioned Knight, made a curious motion.			
<lb/>It closed up into a fist that shot into the palm			
<lb/>of his left hand. Up flashed bright old eyes,			
<lb/>glaring fiercely through double-lensed glasses.			
<lb/>Up lifted the shaggy old head, jerked			
<lb/>amazedly from one to the other of the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>comfited pair before him.</p>
            <p><q>What's this? What’sthise Business hours

            <p>Bully Bill cleared his throat elaborately and			
<lb/>lustered a clumsy step forward.</p>
            <p><q>Just come over to the house to tell you

<lb/>for his pay</q>.</p>
            <p><q>You've what?</q></p>
            <p><q>Fired </q></p>
            <p>Half arising from his feet, P. D. emitted			
<lb/>a long, blood-curdling, blistering string of			
<lb/>original curses that caused even his hardened			
<lb/>foreman to blench. That raised voite, those</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 179]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>unmistakable words of wrath penetrated			
<lb/>‘ across the room and into the cocked ear of			
<lb/>Sandy’s sleeping dog. Full and exciting as			
<lb/>the owner of Viper made all of his days, the			
<lb/>exhausted animal never failed, when opportu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nity offered, to secure such rest as fate might			
<lb/>allow him from the wild career through which			
<lb/>his master daily whirled him. Nevertheless			
<lb/>that raised and testy voice, for all Viper knew,			
<lb/>might be directed against the one he loved			
<lb/>best on earth.</p>
            <p>Viper turned a moist nose mournfully to			
<lb/>the ceiling, and ere the last of the scorching			
<lb/>words of P. D. McPherson had left his lips,			
<lb/>a low moan of exquisite sympathy and pain			
<lb/>came from the direction of the overstuffed			
<lb/>couch. Instantly the red, alarmed flush of			
<lb/>guilt and terror flooded the freckled face of			
<lb/>the owner of the dog, as wriggling around to			
<lb/>escape that raised hand of his furious parent,			
<lb/>Sandy added chaos to confusion by upsetting			
<lb/>the sacred chess board.</p>
            <p>There was a roar from the outraged chess			
<lb/>player, a whining protest from the boy, duck-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 180 ]</fw>
            <pb n="181"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>ing out of his way, and at that critical moment,			
<lb/>Viper sprang to the defence of his master.			
<lb/>Planting himself before P. D. McPherson,			
<lb/>the little dog barked furiously and menacingly,			
<lb/>and then fled before the foot kicked out for			
<lb/>dire punishment. Pandemonium broke loose			
<lb/>in that lately quiet room, dedicated to the			
<lb/>scientific, silent game of chess.</p>

<lb/>him for an easy means of exit.</p>
            <p><q>Get him out! Get him out! Get him out!</q>			
<lb/>shouted P. D., and, seizing a golf club, he			
<lb/>jabbed at the swiftly disappearing animal.			
<lb/>For awhile, dog and boy cavorted through			
<lb/>the room, the one racing to safe places under			
<lb/>sofas and behind chairs and piano, and the			
<lb/>other coaxing, pleading, threatening, till at			
<lb/>last, crawling cravenly along the floor on his

            <p>There was a flash, a streak across the room,			
<lb/>and the dog had disappeared into some corner			
<lb/>of the great ranch house. The boy, with a

            <p>Sandy, who had returned as far as the door,

            <p>Hilda was almost upon the verge of hys<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>terics. She was inarticulate with rage and			
<lb/>excitement. The thought of Sandy confiding			
<lb/>in Cheerio that she was <q>stuck</q> on him was			
<lb/>unendurable.</p>

            <p><q>Why so much excitement?</q> queried her

            <p>At that moment, a gentle cough at the door			
<lb/>turned all eyes in its direction. Natty and			
<lb/>clean, in his grey English suit—the one he			
<lb/>had worn that first day he had come to O Bar			
<lb/>O—Cheerio was standing in the room looking			
<lb/>about him pleasantly at the circle of expres<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sive faces. No sooner had the girl’s angry			
<lb/>glance crossed his own friendly one, than out			
<lb/>popped the despised word:</p>
            <p><q>Cheerio!</q> said Cheerio.</p>
            <p>His glance rested deeply upon Hilda for a			
<lb/>moment, and then quietly withdrew. Sandy,			
<lb/>whose allegiance to his former hero and			
<lb/>oracle had been somewhat shattered by the			
<lb/>corral incidents, suddenly grinned at his friend			
<lb/>and favoured him with a knowing wink.</p>

            <p>The words were pouring out breathlessly</p>
            <p>from the almost sobbing Hilda. Cheerio re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>garded her gravely and then looked away. At			
<lb/>sight of the upturned chess table, he whistled			
<lb/>softly, stepped forward and set it in place.			
<lb/>Stooping again, he picked up the scattered			
<lb/>chessmen and then, to the amazement of all			
<lb/>in that room, Cheerio calmly proceeded to			
<lb/>set the men precisely in place upon the board.			
<lb/>As he put the King, the Queen, the Bishop,

<lb/>Englishman.</p>
            <p><q>You play chess, sir?</q></p>
            <p><q>A bit</q>.</p>
            <p>A speck of colour came out on either of the

            <p><q>Very good, sir. We will have a game</q>.</p>

            <p>Slowly, carefully, P. D. responded with a

            <p>Cheerio made no second move. He was

            <p>A snort came from Sandy and a smile from			
<lb/>Hilda.</p>
            <p><q>The poor simp!</q> audibly chuckled the boy.			
<lb/>Hilda was laconic and to the point:</p>

            <p>P. D. merely looked over his glasses with

            <p>Cheerio’s Knight made its eccentric jump,			
<lb/>and after a long pause the ranchman’s Bishop			
<lb/>swept the board. Cheerio put forward an<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>other pawn, and down came P. D.’s Queen.			
<lb/>His opponent’s King was now menaced from</p>

            <p>two sides, on the one by P. D.’s Queen and			
<lb/>on the other by his Bishop. Cheerio’s ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pression was blank, as after a pause he neatly			
<lb/>picked up and put another pawn one pace			
<lb/>forward. P. D. was holding his lower lip			
<lb/>between forefinger and thumb, a characteris<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tic attitude when in concerned thought. There</p>
            <p>was deep silence in the room, and it was fifteen			
<lb/>minutes before the ranchman made his next			
<lb/>move; ten before the Englishman made his.</p>
            <p>Hilda’s breath was suspended, her cheeks			
<lb/>scarlet, her eyes wide with excitement, while			
<lb/>Sandy, his mouth agape, watched the moves			
<lb/>with unabated amazement.</p>
            <p>Bully Bill, meanwhile, discreetly departed.			
<lb/>Once Cheerio had taken his seat opposite the			
<lb/>old chess monomaniac his foreman realized			
<lb/>that <q>the jig was up</q>. He did not admit de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>feat to his men. That would have been a			
<lb/>reflection upon his own influence at O Bar O.			
<lb/>Bully Bill gave forth the information that			
<lb/>Cheerio had given a satisfactory explanation			
<lb/>of his action at the branding, and the <q>con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fession</q> which Holy Smoke had overheard</p>

            <p>must ’ve been <q>a sort of a mistake. Because			
<lb/>there ain’t nothing to it</q>, said Bully Bill,			
<lb/>chewing hard on his plug, and avoiding the</p>
            <p>amazed eye of the injured Ho.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the living-room of O Bar O,			
<lb/>two more moves had been made and the chess<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>men faced each other in an intricate position			
<lb/>for the one side. With eyes bulging, Sandy			
<lb/>leaned forward, staring at the board, while			
<lb/>Hilda drew her chair close to her father’s.			
<lb/>Slowly there dawned upon the son and daugh<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ter of P. D. McPherson—no mean chess play<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ers, despite their aversion for the game—the			
<lb/>realization that a trap was being deliberately			
<lb/>forged to close in upon their father’s forces.			
<lb/>Hilda wanted to cry out, to warn her old Dad,			
<lb/>but a pronounced twitching of P. D.’s left eye			
<lb/>revealed the fact that he was sensitively cog<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nizant of his danger. Hilda’s hand crept un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>consciously to her throat, as if to still her

<lb/>credulous eyes at the diabolical movements of

<lb/>and positively detested and loathed.</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>There was a long silence. Another move			
<lb/>and a longer pause. P. D.’s trembling old			
<lb/>hand poised above a Knight. Pause. A pawn			
<lb/>slipped to the left of the Knight. The Knight			
<lb/>half raised—no place to go—sacrificed. Out			
<lb/>came the Queen. &lt;A pause. The English<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man’s Bishop swept clear across the board and			
<lb/>took up a cocky position directly in the path			
<lb/>of P. D.’s King. He moved to take the Bishop,			
<lb/>saw the Castle in line, retreated, and found			
<lb/>himself facing Cheerio’s Queen. Another			
<lb/>move, and the Knight had him. A very long			
<lb/>pause. A search for a place to go. P. D.’s			
<lb/>dulled eyes gazed through their specs at			
<lb/>Cheerio, and the latter murmured politely:</p>
            <p><q>Check to your king, sir. Game</q>.</p>
            <p>The dazed P. D. stared in stunned silence			
<lb/>at the board, forefinger and thumb pinching			
<lb/>his underlip.</p>
            <p><q>Holy Salmon!</q> burst from Sandy. A sob

<lb/>on the front page and he gave out interviews			
<lb/>predicting the ruin of the country or its as<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>Cheerio’s proposition, therefore, and the

<lb/>with open arms at O Bar O.</p>
            <p>Hilda, when he revealed the fact that he

            <p>To this perfectly amicable message, P. D.

            <p><q>My father says for you to clear off the

            <p>Hilda came out on to the porch, and seized

<lb/>eyes. How dared they publish for all the

<lb/>old newspapers are. Did you write it?</p>
            <p><q>No, no</q>, hastily denied the reporter. <q>TI

<lb/>some outside stuff telephoned in, probably by

<lb/>by the river, and I can cover the story just			
<lb/>as well from there</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda threw him a look of withering scorn.			
<lb/>Pushed the screen door open, and banged it,			
<lb/>as well as the inside door, in the reporter’s			
<lb/>face.</p>

            <p>He stood in thought a moment on the steps

<lb/>Cheerio was punching the electric bell per<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>opened the door inside, cast a haughty look

<lb/>antly unhooked the latch and let the latter in.			
<lb/>She closed both doors again with a snap.			
<lb/>Sandy, who had not followed Cheerio into			
<lb/>the house, stood grinning up at the reporter,			
<lb/>and the latter was seized with an inspiration.			
<lb/>He returned the jeering stare of P. D.’s son			
<lb/>with a man-to-man look of confidence. Non<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>chalantly, he brought forth a cigarette case

<lb/>upon the grass and his questions came irregu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>larly and presently not at all. Then Cheerio			
<lb/>dumped his pipe, shook the half-asleep boy,			
<lb/>and said:</p>
            <p><q/><q>Come on, old man. Time to get back</q>,			
<lb/>and Sandy sat up with a start, rubbed his</p>

            <p>eyes, yawned, and unwillingly arose and			
<lb/>moved toward Silver Heels, whose bridle had			
<lb/>slipped down the slender trunk of the tree to			
<lb/>which it had been loosely tied.</p>
            <p>At the ranch house, the nightly games pro<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ceeded. Sometimes a game would end with</p>
            <p>a single night’s playing; at other times a game			
<lb/>would drag along for a week.</p>
            <p>Cheerio had won three games in succession,			
<lb/>when he suggested that his opponent should			
<lb/>be allowed a handicap. P. D. received this			
<lb/>generous suggestion with hostility and fury.</p>
            <p><q>What for? What for? Because you win			
<lb/>a damnation game or two, do you mean to			
<lb/>insinuate that I am out of your class?</q></p>
            <p><q>Nn-n-not at all, sir</q>, stammered Cheerio,			
<lb/>‘b-b-but you see, I’ve a b-b-bit of an advan<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tage over you, sir. B-b-been playing ch-chess			
<lb/>for a long time b-b-before coming to the			
<lb/>ranch.</p>
            <p>It was true enough, P. D. admitted, that he			
<lb/>was off his game on account of having had			
<lb/><q>only children and amateurs</q> to play with.			
<lb/>Nevertheless he had not fallen to the damned</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">{ 212 ]</fw>

            <p>handicap class. There were thirty-one days in			
<lb/>the month; they had been playing but ten in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>conclusive and insignificant days; he was			
<lb/>neither a cripple nor a moron and he’d give his			
<lb/>opponent a dashed stiff fight before he was			
<lb/>through with him, and he asked for no quarter			
<lb/>whatsoever now.</p>
            <p>The fierceness with which the old man took			
<lb/>his well-meaning suggestion caused Cheerio			
<lb/>to stammer further explanations. During his			
<lb/>recent stay in Germany, so he said, he had			
<lb/>played constantly, and the Germans were ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cellent players.</p>
            <p>This was the first intimation that he had			
<lb/>been in Germany, and the information passed			
<lb/>over P. D.’s head as of no especial interest,			
<lb/>but Hilda’s eyes narrowed and she began to			
<lb/>speculate v on the cause of his presence in			
<lb/>their late enemy’s country. From day to day,			
<lb/>Hilda had been hardening her heart more and			
<lb/>more against him and she was ready to believe			
<lb/>the worst. Hilda had her opinion of a man			
<lb/>who pretended to be a cowpuncher, who wore			
<lb/>a piece of jewellery dangling from a black</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[213 ]</fw>

            <p>fob at his waist. She despised the type of man,			
<lb/>so she told herself, who carried a woman’s face			
<lb/>in a locket. Only a <q>sissy</q> would do an asi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nine and slushy thing like that, and sissies			
<lb/>were not popular in the ranching country.			
<lb/>However, apparently unconscious of, or in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>different to, her glance of scorn at the depised			
<lb/>locket, he continued daily to wear it, and quite			
<lb/>often, right before her eyes, even lovingly and			
<lb/>tenderly toyed with it.</p>
            <p><q>What were you doing in Germany?</q>			
<lb/>queried Sandy, pop-eyed with interest.</p>
            <p>Cheerio moved uneasily, thrust his hand			
<lb/>through his hair, looked dashed and worried,			
<lb/>and shook his head.</p>
            <p><q>When were you there?</q> persisted Sandy.			
<lb/><q>Was it when the war was on?</q></p>
            <p><q>Y-y-y-yes, I believe it wa </q> admitted			
<lb/>Cheerio, uncertainly.</p>

            <p><q>Well—</q> began Cheerio, miserably, <q>‘you

            <p><q>Chess, by all means, sir</q>. Thus Cheerio,			
<lb/>placatingly, and with evident relief at the			
<lb/>change of subject. To Sandy, he promised:</p>

<lb/>persuasively:</p>
            <p><q>How about it, governor? It’s quite fair			
<lb/>under the circumstances that I should yield			
<lb/>you something. What do you say to a Castle?

            <p><q>Sir, when I want quarter, I’ll ask for it.			
<lb/>I'll have you know that I have never yet taken			
<lb/>a dashed flippity handicap and when the time			
<lb/>comes for me to do that, by Gad! I'll cease			
<lb/>to play. I play, sir, chess, and I want no			
<lb/>damned favouritism. I'll be placed under no			
<lb/>G—D—oblig—D—igation to any man</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Righto! Your move, sir</q>.</p>

            <pb n="216"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>P. D. was indeed off his game. He was,			
<lb/>moreover, the victim of a creeping panic. He			
<lb/>made longer pauses, debated a move for a			
<lb/>solid hour, in the meanwhile moving (in his			
<lb/>head) every single man upon the board; im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>agine their effect in such and such a position,			
<lb/>then presupposing a move which his oppo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nent never intended to make, with a crafty			
<lb/>quiver of a bushy eyebrow old P. D. would			
<lb/>move to the attack, when the position of his			
<lb/>King called for defense.</p>
            <p>Once Cheerio made an obviously bad and			
<lb/>wild move. This was when looking up un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>expectedly he had found Hilda regarding			
<lb/>him, not with her usual expression of hate and			
<lb/>scorn, but with her dark eyes brimming with			
<lb/>something that brought a strange tug to his			
<lb/>heart and dimmed his own eyesight.</p>
            <p>At that bad move, P. D.’s amazed eyes shot			
<lb/>up above his glasses and he coughed angrily.			
<lb/>If his opponent were attempting to curry			
<lb/>favour with him by playing badly, he would			
<lb/>receive no thanks. P. D. removed Cheerio’s			
<lb/>valuable Bishop which had been sacrificed by</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 216 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>his absent move, and snarled across the board:</p>
            <p><q>Damned curious move, sir. You wish to			
<lb/>stop for to-night?</q></p>
            <p><q>M-m-m-ore c-c-areful next time</q>, mur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mured Cheerio, stiffened by the fact that			
<lb/>Hilda had blinked the brightness out of her			
<lb/>eyes, and her chin was at a most disdainful			
<lb/>angle. More careful he was; wary, keen and			
<lb/>cunning. Before the clock pointed to nine			
<lb/>o’clock, Cheerio murmured his firm, if slightly			
<lb/>regretful:</p>
            <p><q>Check! Game!</q></p>
            <p>P. D. studied the board, his eyebrows			
<lb/>twitching. His King was enclosed on all			
<lb/>sides. Not even a chance for stalemate. This,			
<lb/>though Cheerio had sacrificed his Bishop.			
<lb/>P. D. blinked behind his glasses, cleared his			
<lb/>throat noisily and grunted:</p>
            <p><q>Four games for you, sir</q>. After another			
<lb/>noisy clearing of throat:</p>
            <p><q>Tides turn, sir. Tides turn. He ‘laughs			
<lb/>best who laughs last.’ </q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, rather</q>, agreed Cheerio eagerly.</p>
            <p>Undemonstrative Hilda came behind her</p>

            <p>father, solicitous and sweet, hovered above			
<lb/>him a moment, sat on the arm of his chair, put			
<lb/>her arm about his shoulders, cuddled her			
<lb/>warm cheek lovingly against the top of his			
<lb/>grey head. P. D. jerked up, shaking the			
<lb/>embracing arms irritably from his shoulders.</p>
            <p><q>Well, well, what’s this? What’s this?			
<lb/>Stop pawing me</q>, he objected. ‘What in the			
<lb/>name of Holy Christmas are you whimpering			
<lb/>about? I don’t like it. Women’s tears are a			
<lb/>scientific evidence of a weak intellect. Stop			
<lb/>sniffing, I say! Stop leaking on my neck!			
<lb/>Damn dash it all! Get away! Get away!</p>
            <p>Hilda’s rare tears, dropping like pearls			
<lb/>down her russet cheeks, described as leaks! In			
<lb/>the presence of that man, stooping above the			
<lb/>chess board the better to hide the amused grin			
<lb/>that would show despite his best efforts, de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>spite indeed the stony glare (if eyes moist with			
<lb/>running-over tears could stonily glare) that			
<lb/>Hilda favoured him with.</p>
            <p>She had no soft thoughts for him now. If			
<lb/>she could have forgotten his confession at the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 218 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>corrals, Hilda felt that she never, never could			
<lb/>forgive his treatment of her father.</p>
            <p>Just what Hilda would have desired him to			
<lb/>do in the circumstances, cannot be said. She</p>
            <p>would have shared her father’s resentment had			
<lb/>Cheerio purposely played a poor game, in			
<lb/>order to give the older man an opportunity to			
<lb/>win. Nevertheless she bitterly resented the			
<lb/>fact that his victories were crushing the spirit			
<lb/>of the old chess warrior. There had been			
<lb/>some discussion—an idea, in fact, put out in			
<lb/>the newspaper of that miserable reporter who			
<lb/>was camped down by the river, on the edge of			
<lb/>the O Bar O lands, that in the event of P. D.’s			
<lb/>failure to beat the Englishman that the latter			
<lb/>should take his place in Chicago, so that			
<lb/>Canada’s chances of the world championship			
<lb/>might be more likely assured.</p>
            <p>That story, read by Hilda in the newspaper			
<lb/>brought her from the camp by Sandy, and			
<lb/>jealously hidden from her father, caused the			
<lb/>girl’s heart to ache. She was intensely pa<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>triotic, was Hilda, and she desired, as any good			
<lb/>Canadian would, to see the championship</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>wrested from the U. S. A., but she loathed the			
<lb/>thought of the wrester being Cheerio. She			
<lb/>had fondly hoped to see her father in that de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sired role. Her heart coiled in tenderness</p>
            <p>about the crochetty, thorny old man, with his			
<lb/>stumbling moves. She could not recall when			
<lb/>her father had played so poorly or so uncer<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tainly. He seemed to have lost all of his			
<lb/>former skill. His confidence in himself as a			
<lb/>chess player was completely gone. Anyone			
<lb/>could have seen that after watching the old			
<lb/>man play. Even the winning of one game			
<lb/>might have a good effect and restore P. D.’s			
<lb/>former confidence and craft. It was the daily			
<lb/>absorption in the game, and the constant losing			
<lb/>which was having its bad psychological effect			
<lb/>upon him. Hilda knew that if P. D. failed			
<lb/>to keep that Chicago engagement, he would			
<lb/>suffer the bitterest disappointment of his life.			
<lb/>She feared, indeed, it would seriously affect			
<lb/>his health. He would lose his interest in chess			
<lb/>forever, and for P. D. to lose interest in chess			
<lb/>was tantamount to losing interest in life itself.</p>

<lb/>driven for shelter against fence line, lie buried			
<lb/>body on body. Because, therefore, blizzards

<lb/>the month of October, and some outfits round			
<lb/>up as early as September.</p>
            <p>At O Bar O this year there was an atmo<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>to the home fields, where they would find			
<lb/>ample protection under the long cattle sheds,			
<lb/>and be given proper care and attention over			
<lb/>the winter months.</p>
            <p>For more than a month streams of cattle			
<lb/>belonging to other outfits had been passing			
<lb/>daily along the Banff Highway, coming down			
<lb/>from the summer range on the Indian or

<lb/>matter of O Bar O round-up aroused his irri<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tation and profanity to a hair-splitting degree.			
<lb/>The harassed foreman was beside himself			
<lb/>with anxiety and uncertainty. The sight of			
<lb/>his men slouching about the corrals and the

<lb/>He had worked his wits all through the month

<lb/>man was of a sort for which a rider feels only

            <p>growl among themselves and cast black looks			
<lb/>at the ranch house. Two of them had quit the			
<lb/>service of the old ranch, two first-class men,			
<lb/>at that, and Bully Bill noted them later upon			
<lb/>the Banff Highway, riding with a hated rival			
<lb/>outfit.</p>
            <p>The O Bar O prided itself on maintaining			
<lb/>a prize crew of men. They knew every inch			
<lb/>of the range which extended over a hundred			
<lb/>and fifty thousand acres into the foothills of			
<lb/>the Rocky Mountains. They knew the brands			
<lb/>of half the cattlemen in Alberta. They could			
<lb/>pick out O Bar O stock even when the brand			
<lb/>was overgrown. At this time of year, skilled			
<lb/>labour of this sort were in great demand and			
<lb/>could choose their own jobs and demand their

<lb/>they would give ear to the solicitations of rival

            <p>fied to engage men trained at O Bar O and

<lb/>which he declared had strayed on to O Bar O.

<lb/>rush season was over and left them high and			
<lb/>dry for the winter. On the other hand, P. D.			
<lb/>did not raise his men’s wages in the busy sea-</p>
            <p>sons, but kept them on all winter, regardless of			
<lb/>slack periods and the drop of price in cattle.			
<lb/>At Christmas, moreover, if the stock were in			
<lb/>healthy shape and the profit of the business			
<lb/>warranted it, O Bar O men received an annual			
<lb/>bonus.</p>

<lb/>about waiting for P. D. to give the order to			
<lb/>set out upon the round-up, considerable of the			
<lb/>men’s wages had disappeared in poker games

<lb/>game, the girl joined the foreman and his as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sistant upon the verandah.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda</q> began Bully Bill, <q>Ho and			
<lb/>I are here to-night to ask you what’re we goin’			
<lb/>to do about the cattle? We can’t afford to			
<lb/>wait no longer</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda debated the matter, hand on chin.			
<lb/>She was looking off quite absently and sud<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>denly she said to Bully Bill:</p>
            <p><q>Took here, Bill, if Dad had only moved			
<lb/>his Knight instead of his Castle, he could			
<lb/>have checked his King from both ends of the			
<lb/>board and the jig would have been up. But			
<lb/>Dad’s losing his nerve. He’s been beat too			
<lb/>often lately. I can just see him fairly break<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing. It’s telling on him. He’s an old man, my			
<lb/>Dad is, and it’s terrible at his age to lose confi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dence. So long as Dad knew he was the best			
<lb/>player in the West, he was just as cocky and			
<lb/>spunky as a two-year-old, but you ought to see			
<lb/>him now. Bunched up in his chair, his old</q></p>

            <p>eyes dim, and the eyebrows sticking out and			
<lb/>his lip bulged. You’d hardly know him. Oh!			
<lb/>if he had only moved his Knight! I could			
<lb/>just have slapped him when he lifted that			
<lb/>darned Castle. I tell you, Bill, Dad has			
<lb/>simply got to beat him. He’s got to win at			
<lb/>least one game. He’d never survive a perma<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nent defeat, and apart from Dad’s feelings,			
<lb/>neither would I!</p>
            <p><q>But, look-a-here, Miss Hilda, what’re we			
<lb/>all agoin’ to do till then? We can’t allow			
<lb/>them cattle to be out till end of November.			
<lb/>Why, them cattle </q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, the cattle! The cattle! You give me			
<lb/>a pain! Can’t you think of anything but cattle,			
<lb/>cattle, cattle? I guess there’s people in the			
<lb/>world as well as cattle, cattle!</q></p>
            <p><q>So there are, miss, but at this time of year			
<lb/>we got to think of the cattle first, or they’ll get			
<lb/>thinking with their own feet and first thing we</q></p>
            <p>know theyll wander off somewheres where</p>
            <p>you ain’t goin’ to see them no more. Just let</p>

            <p>last of em. Besides, I heered down in Coch<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rane that there’s a sight of rustlers prowlin’			
<lb/>around this year, and the Indians ain’t any too			
<lb/>scrupilous and when they’re hungry, they ain’t			
<lb/>depising no handy beef. Why, Jim Lame<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>Leg’s doin’ time now for as slick a trick as			
<lb/>ever I heerd of. Drive a cow over a canyon,			
<lb/>and then git the job of haulin’ her out, and			
<lb/>when she’s out she’s got her leg broke and she			
<lb/>dies on his hand, and the owner pays for the			
<lb/>haulin’ of the cow out with the dead carcass.			
<lb/>Lee caught ’im breakin’ a leg of one of the			
<lb/>Lazy L’s stock and the boss told him to go			
<lb/>ahead and shoot her and keep the carcass, till			
<lb/>someone put him wise, and he had the Mounty			
<lb/>down from the Reserve and Jim Lame-Leg’s			
<lb/>doin’ time now. If we don’t look out there'll			
<lb/>be others just as smart as Jim and when we			
<lb/>come to countin’ up stock, I betchu we'll be			
<lb/>out a dozen head and more.</p>
            <p><q>Well, it’s pretty bad, I know, but I won’t			
<lb/>have Dad bothered about cattle. He’s got			
<lb/>enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I

            <p><q>Herders! My foot! Excuse my cussing,			
<lb/>miss, but when you talk of herders,—my gosh!			
<lb/>Herders ain’t a bit of good when the cold			
<lb/>snap comes. They keep in their tents and			
<lb/>holler for the riders and that’s what the riders			
<lb/>is for</q>.</p>
            <p><q>But then, look at the weather this year.			
<lb/>The cattle’ll get along for a month yet, I do			
<lb/>believe. Last year we had soft weather clear			
<lb/>up till Christmas. You know that and lots of			
<lb/>cattle people were sorry they hadn’t taken ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>the range. Anyway, they'll come trailing home

            <p><q>Some’ll come home, sure enough, but we

            <p>Hilda was leaning forward, wide-eyed with			
<lb/>delighted interest. Dad’s utterances were al<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ways matters of the profoundest psychological			
<lb/>interest and pride to his admiring daughter.</p>
            <p>Bully Bill lowered his voice confidentially.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda, I ain’t got the nerve to repeat			
<lb/>to you the curious string of damns and cusses			
<lb/>that your father give me and </q></p>
            <p>Hilda laughed, a rippling girlish chuckle			
<lb/>of genuine pride and delight.</p>
            <p><q>Isn’t Dad a perfect peach when he starts			
<lb/>swearing? Don’t you love it? It sounds so—			
<lb/>so—healthy, somehow. Can’t he just rip out</q></p>
            <p>the dandiest string of swear words you ever			
<lb/>did hear? I'll bet there’s not another man in			
<lb/>the entire country can cuss as my Dad can.			
<lb/>Most of ’em run off just the ordinary common			
<lb/>old damns, but Dad—why Dad can—can—			
<lb/>literally coin cuss words. I’d rather hear my			
<lb/>Dad cuss than—than—hear a prima donna			
<lb/>sing. Why, do you know, the very first word			
<lb/>that either Sandy or I learned to speak was			
<lb/>‘damn’!</p>

            <p>teeth shone as her fresh laughter rippled forth,			
<lb/>and at that musical sound, and the sight of the			
<lb/>beautiful, laughing young woman before him,			
<lb/>moved by an irresistible impulse, Holy Smoke,			
<lb/>who had been squatting at his work, jumped			
<lb/>restlessly to his feet. Hilda’s back was to the			
<lb/>door. The hall was dark behind her.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda</q>, said Ho, ingratiatingly, <q>we			
<lb/>thought as how if you would ask your father</q></p>
            <p/>

            <p><q>You said it</q>, grinned Ho delightedly,

            <p><q>What's that you say?</q></p>
            <p>Hilda’s voice had risen with excitement.			
<lb/>Someone came out of the living-room inside,			
<lb/>and paused half-way across the hall on his way			
<lb/>to the verandah.</p>

            <p>At the mention of Cheerio, the dark blood			
<lb/>had rushed into the face of the girl. Her			
<lb/>glance was full of contempt and hatred now.</p>
            <p><q>You, Holy Smoke! Yes, you’d need to

            <p><q>Since you’re so stuck on him

            <p>with Cheerio. Even in the moonlight, she			
<lb/>could see that his face was set and stern as his			
<lb/>glance passed by her and rested upon the shift<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing gaze of Ho, who suddenly, hurriedly			
<lb/>moved away.</p>
            <p>There was no sound now but the sobbing			
<lb/>breath of the excited Hilda. Bully Bill had			
<lb/>followed his assistant. She was alone on the			
<lb/>verandah with Cheerio. A moment she			
<lb/>looked up in the quiet moonlight at the man			
<lb/>she had told herself so often that she hated.</p>
            <p>What must he think of her now? Had he			
<lb/>heard Holy Smoke’s taunt? Would he believe			
<lb/>then that she— The thought was intolerable			
<lb/>an agony; but her agony was turned to a			
<lb/>curious bliss, when, quite suddenly, she felt			
<lb/>her hand warmly enclosed. For a long mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment, he held her captive and she felt the deep			
<lb/>gaze of his eyes searching her own. Then she			
<lb/>was released, and like one in a dream she			
<lb/>heard rather than saw him moving away from			
<lb/>her. Unconsciously, a sob in her throat, Hilda			
<lb/>McPherson held out her arms toward him.			
<lb/>But he did not see her. She had a sudden</p>

            <p>frantic apprehension that he would go after			
<lb/>Holy Smoke—that there would be a fight and			
<lb/>he— An almost primitive fear of harm be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>falling him, sent Hilda along to the edge of			
<lb/>the verandah. Then she heard something			
<lb/>that stopped her flight, and held her there,			
<lb/>straining to hear the last note of that long,			
<lb/>soft whistle which rose in crescendo like a			
<lb/>bird’s song that dropped across the silence of			
<lb/>the night and slowly melted away.</p>
            <p>Something rose in a suffocating flood in the			
<lb/>heart of the Alberta-born girl. Spellbound			
<lb/>and shaken, suddenly Hilda consciously faced			
<lb/>the truth: She loved!</p>

<lb/>the place as his own private and personal pre<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>enough to go the rounds of the newspaper

            <p>He had a moderately good feature story, but			
<lb/>had been obliged to do a lot of padding,

<lb/>sense of romance scented another kind of story			
<lb/>atO Bar O. This Englishman—whatever his			
<lb/>name was (of course, Cheerio was merely a

<lb/>plain that he was no ordinary ranch hand.			
<lb/>Who, then, was he, and what was he doing

            <p><q>Younger son</q>, and, for that matter, older			
<lb/>sons, were not uncommon in the Alberta			
<lb/>ranching country. It was in fact, an ideal			
<lb/>place, for the disposal of ne’er-do-wells, and			
<lb/>if they had the <q>stuff</q> in them to make real			
<lb/>men of them. The reporter had come into			
<lb/>contact with a great many of these quite lik<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able chaps from the old country, especially			
<lb/>upon those periodical occasions when remit<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tances from home were due, they came to town			
<lb/>to spend a monthly allowance in a single night,			
<lb/>or several days of unadulterated spreeing.			
<lb/>They were not noted especially for their love			
<lb/>of work, though there was good stuff in most			
<lb/>of them as was proved when the war broke			
<lb/>out and a large percentage of the men who			
<lb/>marched from Alberta were of English birth.</p>
            <p>This Cheerio fellow was somehow different.			
<lb/>Mallison could not exactly place him. He			
<lb/>worked. In point of fact, Cheerio was re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>puted to be one of the best workers atO Bar O			
<lb/>and really earned his modest $50 a month.			
<lb/>Nevertheless, the newspaper man recognised

            <p>ing. Mallison had heard the story of the			
<lb/>branding, and of the confession that had fol<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>the reporter, sifting the facts in the case, was</p>
            <p>disposed to question whether this incident			
<lb/>should be regarded seriously. From Cheerio			
<lb/>himself he learned scarcely nothing. Several			
<lb/>times intent upon acquiring a real interview			
<lb/>with the man, he was exasperated to discover			
<lb/>after Cheerio had left him that Cheerio, on the			
<lb/>contrary, had interviewed him. He was ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tremely interested, apparently, in newspaper			
<lb/>work, and asked the reporter many questions			
<lb/>concerning the sort of papers supported by the			
<lb/>City of Calgary, and also what opportunity			
<lb/>there might be for a man to get a berth on one			
<lb/>of these as a caricaturist or newspaper artist.</p>
            <p>Ruminating over the matter, the reporter			
<lb/>lay flat upon the ground on his back, hands			
<lb/>under the back of his head, staring straight up

            <p>bright star pinned to his vest. Now, that star			
<lb/>represented the fact that the reporter had cer<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tain rights at fires and other places where the			
<lb/>press is permitted to be represented ; but to the			
<lb/>hunter it looked fearfully like the star that a			
<lb/>game warden might carry. He essayed a con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ciliating laugh, while backing hastily toward			
<lb/>the exit at the bridge outside of which his			
<lb/>Studebaker was parked. He got into it in a			
<lb/>great hurry.</p>
            <p>Grinning, Mallison sat up, his eye upon the			
<lb/>out-jutting rock where the grouse had fallen.			
<lb/>Lazily he stretched himself; leisurely he			
<lb/>climbed up the cliff to the rock and lightly he			
<lb/>dropped down in Cheerio’s cave.</p>
            <p>He swung around in a circle, blinking his			
<lb/>eyes and emitting a long, amazed whistle.</p>
            <p>For the next half hour he was a very busy			
<lb/>reporter. Aladdin’s cave could have afforded			
<lb/>him no more satisfaction or interest.</p>
            <p>The Indian pictures were ranged along a			
<lb/>shelf in the natural gallery that stretched			
<lb/>under the rock for a space of about thirty feet.			
<lb/>It was amply lighted and completely shel-</p>

            <p>tered. As Mallison went down the line of			
<lb/>pictures he realized that here was indeed a rare			
<lb/>find.</p>
            <p>Colour had been splashed prodigally upon			
<lb/>the canvasses. Maroon, lemon, magenta, scar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>let, vivid purple, cerise, blues, flame colour.			
<lb/>Indian colours! Indian faces! Here was			
<lb/>more than a mere tribe of Indians. The artist			
<lb/>had stamped indelibly upon the canvas a reve<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lation of the history of a passing race. He			
<lb/>had painted the Iliad of the Indian race.</p>
            <p>Here was an ancient chief, grave, stern as			
<lb/>a judge, with the dignity of a king and a			
<lb/>pride that all the squalor and poverty and			
<lb/>starvation of a long, hard life, the repression			
<lb/>and tyranny at the hands of successive Indian			
<lb/>agents and parasites upon his race, had been			
<lb/>unable to quench.</p>
            <p>Here, the infinitely old and wrinkled, tooth<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less, witch-like great-great-grandmother of the			
<lb/>tribe, a crone who mumbled prophetic warn<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ings to which the lightest-hearted paid super<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>stitious heed. And here the blind Medicine			
<lb/>Man.</p>

            <p>Smiling, wheedling, begging, the pleas<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>antly-plump shining-faced squaws. The			
<lb/>Braves, young and old, variously clad, some			
<lb/>clinging to the garb of their ancestors, or wear<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing the holiday dress, gaudy Hudson’s Bay			
<lb/>blankets and rugs and headdresses of eagle or			
<lb/>turkey feathers; others in the half cowboy,			
<lb/>half Indian clothes, and others again poorly			
<lb/>attired in the mockery of the white man’s			
<lb/>clothes.</p>
            <p>Thin faces, deep and hungry-eyed, with			
<lb/>that. subdued look that tells not so much of the			
<lb/>conquering hand of the white man as of the in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sidious effects of the great white plague.</p>
            <p>Tragic faces of half-breeds, pawns of an un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>desired fate. Something of smouldering wild<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ness, something of sadness, something of in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tense longing and wistfulness looked from the			
<lb/>strange eyes of the breeds, legally white and			
<lb/>permitted the <q>privilege</q> of the franchise,			
<lb/>subject to conscription and taxation, yet			
<lb/>doomed to live among their red kindred.</p>
            <p>Beauty peered from the half-lifted ragged

            <p>whose back the tiny blonde head of a blue<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>eyed papoose told a story more eloquent than			
<lb/>words.</p>
            <p>This, then, was the <q>find</q> of the newspaper			
<lb/>man. Of the pictures, he selected six. He had			
<lb/>no compunction about helping himself. It			
<lb/>was part of his trade, and he had discovered			
<lb/>the cave. What is more, he cherished the en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thusiastic ambition of making the unknown			
<lb/>artist famous. There were people in Calgary			
<lb/>who would appreciate what this man had done.			
<lb/>Mallison intended to show his find to these			
<lb/>connoisseurs.</p>
            <p>From the Indian pictures, he turned to the			
<lb/>portfolio of sketches. Several of Sandy and			
<lb/>the ranch hands, one of Bully Bill, with the			
<lb/>quid of tobacco in his cheek, a characteristic			
<lb/>bit of old P. D., one of Viper at the heels of			
<lb/>the milk cows, a stream of cattle pouring over			
<lb/>the hill, and—Hilda! One hundred and			
<lb/>eighteen sketches of Hilda McPherson. Now			
<lb/>the reporter understood, and he chuckled with			
<lb/>sympathy. He did not blame the man. He			
<lb/>had seen Hilda!</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>From the portfolio, Mallison selected two			
<lb/>or three sketches of P. D., one of Sandy, three			
<lb/>of Hilda, and a single photograph of Cheerio,			
<lb/>taken evidently in France, and in uniform.			
<lb/>He was easily recognizable. There was no			
<lb/>mistaking that boyish and friendly smile, that			
<lb/>seemed somehow to irradiate and make singu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>larly interesting the essentially sensitive fea<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tures of the young Englishman.</p>

            <p>There would be an interval, then, when			
<lb/>Cheerio and Hilda would find themselves

<lb/>with seeming absorption out of the window.			
<lb/>Then he would bring forth his tobacco pouch,			
<lb/>fill and light his pipe and dip down in the			
<lb/>pocket of his old coat and bring up a book.			
<lb/>Hilda’s absorption in the outside view would			
<lb/>undergo a swift change. Against her will, she			
<lb/>found herself watching him furtively. It fas<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>to his pocket as if it were something precious.			
<lb/>She had satisfied her curiosity as to the titles			
<lb/>and the authors of the books he read. She had			
<lb/>never heard the names before, and suffered a			
<lb/>pang that he should be close to matters con<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>tried to comfort and reassure herself. Even

<lb/>had been merely the rough types peculiar to

<lb/>might be discovered right within the pages of

            <p>He had made that remark to no one in par<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ticular one night, as he gently closed the book			
<lb/>in his hand, and reached for the tobacco pouch			
<lb/>in his rough tweed pocket. Then he had filled

            <p>seemed to be a brown study in which Hilda			
<lb/>and all the rest of the world appeared to dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>appear from his ken.</p>
            <p>Cheerio had a trick of disappearing, as it			
<lb/>was, in this manner—disappearing, mentally.			
<lb/>Always there would then arise something tor<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>turing in the breast of Hilda McPherson. She			
<lb/>had a passionate curiosity to know where the			
<lb/>mind of the dreaming man had leaped in

<lb/>Figures rose about him. Hilda had an intui<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tive knowledge of the types of people who			
<lb/>were his familiars on the other side. Always			
<lb/>among them was the smiling woman, whose

            <p>something of her pain would have been surely

<lb/>ture found itself incapable of wrestling with			
<lb/>the exquisite impulses that despite her best

<lb/>to retort from the depths of her heart that that

<lb/>She could not—would not—dared not believe

            <p>Hilda was not subtle enough to search her

            <p>Several heads bent above typewriters raised

<lb/>Charley Munns, City Editor of the Calgary

            <p><q>Well?</q></p>
            <p>Mallison proceeded to untie the string about			
<lb/>his package. Munns glanced at the first of the			
<lb/>pictures, jerked his chin out and looked again.			
<lb/>Mallison showed the second and then, slowly,			
<lb/>the third. Munns had pushed back the heap			
<lb/>of papers. Pipe in hand, tired young blue

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the remarkable sketches. An interested group			
<lb/>had gathered at the back of the city editor’s			
<lb/>chair, and the sketches passed from hand to			
<lb/>hand. Mallison who had, without words,			
<lb/>merely laid the package of sketches before his			
<lb/>city editor, continued reticent when questioned			
<lb/>by the staff.</p>
            <p><q>Whose work was it? Where had he got

<lb/>they doing in Calgary?</q> and so forth.</p>
            <p>Oh, they were the work of a friend of his.			
<lb/>Didn’t matter who. None of them knew his			
<lb/>name. No, they hadn’t been exhibited.</p>
            <p>Then he sat him down by the ‘<q>Chief’s</q>			
<lb/>desk, hugged his chin, and stared gloomily be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fore him. The men were back at their desks,			
<lb/>and Munns signed some slips, and then turned			
<lb/>his attention back to his reporter.</p>
            <p><q>Good work. Typical Stoneys, eh? Don’t

            <p>The city editor had picked up again one of</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>the sketches and was examining it interestedly.			
<lb/>It was of a young girl, standing on the top of			
<lb/>a hill, her horse, reins dropped, behind her,			
<lb/>its mane blowing in the wind. She was in			
<lb/>breeks, with a boy’s riding boots and her			
<lb/>sweater was a bright scarlet. On her head			
<lb/>was a black velvet tam. Something in the			
<lb/>wide-eyed dreaming look of the girl, as if she			
<lb/>were gazing across over an immense distance,			
<lb/>seeing probably hills yet higher than the one			
<lb/>on which she stood, with the clear blue skies			
<lb/>as her only background, held the attention of			
<lb/>the jaded city editor.</p>

            <p>tograph of Cheerio was suddenly revealed.			
<lb/>Charley Munns’ brows were puckering. One			
<lb/>other talent this man possessed. An almost

<lb/>that he never forgot a face once seen.</p>

            <p>He had swung around a rackety file, that

<lb/>slapped down upon the desk a pile of press

            <p>Editor and reporter scanned the story			
<lb/>swiftly. There was no question now as to the			
<lb/>identity of the man at O Bar O. Cheerio’s			
<lb/>obit read like a romance. Son and heir of			
<lb/>Lord Chelsmore, he had left his art studios in			
<lb/>Italy to return to England, there to enlist as			
<lb/>a common soldier in the ranks. Among those

            <p>succeeded to the title and estates and had mar<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>Charley Munns glanced through the vari<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>them back into the big manila envelope.</p>

<lb/>he said. <q>This man is probably the real Lord

<lb/>a fine feature story, if you want to do it</q>.</p>
            <p>But the reporter was staring out angrily be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fore him. Certain instincts were warring			
<lb/>within him. He wanted to shove his knees

<lb/>ing out a story that would proclaim Cheerio’s			
<lb/>secret to the world. But a feeling of com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>punction and shame held him back.</p>
            <p>After all, the fellow had a right to his own

<lb/>lison’s mind went back to those long, pleasant

<lb/>gether. He recalled a day, when with a			
<lb/>friendly smile, Cheerio had tossed from his</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>horse into Mallison’s arms a fine haunch of			
<lb/>venison. A man couldn’t buy venison from			
<lb/>the Indians, nor, at that time, could he shoot			
<lb/>deer. The Indians alone had that right, and			
<lb/>while they were not permitted to sell venison			
<lb/>to the white men, there was no law to prevent			
<lb/>them from making gifts of the desired meat.			
<lb/>Nor was there any law that prevented the			
<lb/>white man returning the compliment with a			
<lb/>bag of sugar or a can of molasses or whatever			
<lb/>sweet stuff the red man might demand.			
<lb/>Cheerio remarked that he had no use for the			
<lb/>venison at the ranch house and the stuff was a			
<lb/>hanged sight better cooked over a camp fire,			
<lb/>so <q>There you are, old man. One minute, and			
<lb/>I'll give you a hand</q>.</p>
            <p>He had built the fire and he had cut up and			
<lb/>broiled the venison, and he had spread it			
<lb/>thickly with O Bar O butter, and with a			
<lb/>friendly grin, he had dished it out to the			
<lb/>camper.</p>
            <p>Mallison felt himself shrivelling under a

<lb/>and the chess game. So why:</p>
            <p>His chair scraped the floor. He leaned

            <p>or so when they would be alone together before</p>
            <p>her father awoke.</p>
            <p>Her reins hung loose over her horse’s neck;			
<lb/>her hands were in the pockets of her hide coat;			
<lb/>her head slightly bent, Hilda gave herself up			
<lb/>to a long, aching, yet singularly glowing day			
<lb/>dream. Daisy made her own trail, idly loping			
<lb/>along above the canyon that skirted the Ghost			
<lb/>River, stopping now and then to nibble at the			
<lb/>sweet grass along the paths.</p>
            <p>The woods were very still and lovely. Wide			
<lb/>searchlights of the remaining sunshine pierced			
<lb/>through the branches of the trees and flickered			
<lb/>in and out of the woods, playing in golden,			
<lb/>dancing gleams upon the green growth.</p>
            <p>Brown and gold, deeply red, burnt yellow,			
<lb/>and green, the trees were freighted with glori<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ous beauty. Masses of the leaves fluttered idly			
<lb/>to the ground, moved by the soft fragrant			
<lb/>breeze and the branches on bush and tree			
<lb/>seemed lazily to shake themselves, as if suc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cumbing unwillingly to the slumberous spell			
<lb/>of the quiet Autumn day.</p>
            <p>The flowers beneath the trees still shone,</p>

            <p>their radiance but slightly dulled by the touch			
<lb/>of the night frosts, seeming lovelier indeed, as			
<lb/>if veiled by some softening web-like touch.			
<lb/>Scarlet and bright, all through the wooded			
<lb/>growth, the wild-rose berries grew.</p>
            <p>Coveys of partridge and pheasants fluttered			
<lb/>among the bush, peeked up with bright, in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>quiring eyes at the girl on horse, then hopped			
<lb/>a few paces away, under the thick carpet of			
<lb/>leaves.</p>
            <p>In an open field, swiftly running horses			
<lb/>raced to meet them. Like playful children,			
<lb/>they ran around and in front and on all sides			
<lb/>of Hilda’s mare, thrusting their noses against			
<lb/>hers, and laying their faces across her slender			
<lb/>back, utterly unafraid of the rider, yet timor<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ous and moving at Hilda’s slightest affection<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ate slap or word of reproval when they pressed			
<lb/>too closely.</p>
            <p>She was off again. This time a race across			
<lb/>a wide pasture and into the hills to the west,			
<lb/>turning at the end of a long, wooded climb up —			
<lb/>an almost perpendicular slope, to come out			
<lb/>upon the top of one hill, to climb still higher</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 263 ]</fw>

            <p>to another, into a wide, open space, and again			
<lb/>to a higher hill, till, suddenly, she seemed to be			
<lb/>on the very top of the world.</p>
            <p>Below her, nestling like a small city, the			
<lb/>white and green buildings of the ranch showed.			
<lb/>Very near it seemed, and yet in fact a distance			
<lb/>of two or three miles. From this highest			
<lb/>point, the girl on horse paused to cast a long,			
<lb/>lingering look over the surrounding country			
<lb/>that lay spread below her.</p>
            <p>To the north were dim woods, thick and			
<lb/>dark. An eagle soaring overhead.</p>
            <p>To the east, the wide-spreading pastures			
<lb/>and the long, trailing road to Banff. Dim			
<lb/>forms of cattle and horse observable in the			
<lb/>still lingering light, moving specks upon the			
<lb/>gracious meadows.</p>
            <p>To the south, the lower chain of hills and			
<lb/>the sheep lands. A coyote’s wild moaning call.			
<lb/>A hawk circling toward the ranch house.</p>
            <p>Shining like a jewel in the mellow glow, the

            <p>logs from the Eaue Claire Lumber Camp were			
<lb/>being borne by the hundreds upon the first lap			
<lb/>of their journey to Calgary.</p>
            <p>In the West, hill upon hill and still farther			
<lb/>hill upon hill, and beyond all, the snow			
<lb/>crowned, inescapable immortal range of			
<lb/>Rocky Mountains, a dream, a miracle, emble<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>matic of eternity and peace.</p>
            <p>It was hard indeed to tear her gaze from			
<lb/>the last lingering gleams of that marvellous			
<lb/>sunset. There was that about it that uplifted			
<lb/>and comforted the aching heart. Hilda sighed			
<lb/>and at last her long gaze was reluctantly with<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>drawn, dropped lower over the hill tops, the			
<lb/>woods, and came to rest, alertly and still, upon			
<lb/>a moving shadow that slipped in and out of			
<lb/>the bush in a direct line with the barbed wire			
<lb/>fencing.</p>
            <p>She rode slowly, leisurely, but her reins			
<lb/>were now in her hands. In all her young life,			
<lb/>Hilda McPherson had known not the mean<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing of the word fear. Anger, pain, pity and			
<lb/>now love, had shaken her soul, but of fear she			
<lb/>knew nothing. That anyone should wish to</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 265 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>harm her, was beyond her comprehension. So			
<lb/>she rode forward quietly, almost indifferently.			
<lb/>Nevertheless, Hilda knew that someone was			
<lb/>trailing her. An O Bar O <q>hand</q> or a neigh<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>bour would have come out into the open.			
<lb/>Whoever was following her was keeping pur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>posely under the shadow of the bush. Nor			
<lb/>could it be an Indian. Hilda knew the			
<lb/>Stoneys well. An Indian does not molest a			
<lb/>white woman.</p>
            <p>She pondered over the purpose of the man			
<lb/>who was following her. What did he want?			
<lb/>Why did he not come out into the open?			
<lb/>Thieves and rustlers would not have ventured			
<lb/>as near to the ranch house asthis. Their work			
<lb/>was upon the range.</p>
            <p>Hilda’s horse was now climbing down the			
<lb/>other side of the hill slope, directly toward the			
<lb/>ranch. O Bar O was fenced and cross-fenced			
<lb/>with four wires, every field being laid out for			
<lb/>especial stock. In a country like Alberta,			
<lb/>where ranching is done on a large scale, stock			
<lb/>are seldom penned in barn or stable. They			
<lb/>are loose upon the range. Between each field,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 266 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>antiquated barbed wire gates were kept tightly			
<lb/>closed. These were difficult to open. They			
<lb/>consisted of three or four strands of barbed			
<lb/>wire nailed to light willow fence posts at a			
<lb/>space of about a foot apart. These swung			
<lb/>clear from the ground and when closed			
<lb/>fastened by a loop of the wire to the stout post			
<lb/>at the end of the fencing. They were nasty			
<lb/>things to open, even for the toughened hands			
<lb/>of the cowboy. Hilda. seldom used these			
<lb/>gates. She would go around by the paths that			
<lb/>opened to the main trails where were the great			
<lb/>gates that swung from their own weights and			
<lb/>were made of posts ten feet long. These, how<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ever, were not as desirable for dividing fields,			
<lb/>since they swung too easily and were a temp<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tation to leave open. The old type were pre<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ferred by the ranchers. They kept the cattle			
<lb/>more securely separated.</p>
            <p>This evening, Hilda came over the hill by			
<lb/>the shorter trail, and now she was before the			
<lb/>first of the wire gates.</p>
            <p>The days were getting shorter and already,			
<lb/>though it was scarcely six o’clock, the shadows</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 267 ]</fw>
            <pb n="268"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>were closing in deeply. The rosy skies were			
<lb/>dimming and the pressing shadows crept im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>perceptibly over the gilded sky.</p>
            <p>Quite suddenly darkness fell. The trail,			
<lb/>however, was close to the gate and her horse			
<lb/>knew the way. Hilda did not dismount.			
<lb/>Leaning from her horse, she grasped the post			
<lb/>and tugged at the tightly wedged ring of wire.</p>
            <p>Her first knowledge of the near presence of			
<lb/>the man who had followed her came when			
<lb/>something thudded down at her horse’s feet.			
<lb/>In the half light of the fading day Hilda saw			
<lb/>that uncoiled rope.</p>
            <p>The lariat!</p>
            <p>Now she understood and a gasp of rage es<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>caped her. The man had attempted to rope			
<lb/>her. The lariat had fallen short! She, Hilda			
<lb/>McPherson, daughter of O Bar O, to be Iari<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ated like a head of stock!</p>
            <p>As she watched the rope slowly being coiled			
<lb/>in, the sickening thought rushed upon her that			
<lb/>presently it would be thrown again, and that			
<lb/>second throw might fall true. Instantly she			
<lb/>was off her horse, had grasped the end of the</p>

            <p>lariat, whipped it about the gate post, tied a			
<lb/>tight knot, ducked under the wire of the fence,			
<lb/>and secure in the knowledge that her pursuer			
<lb/>would be held back by the closed gate, unless			
<lb/>he dismounted and took her own means of			
<lb/>passing through, Hilda ran like the wind			
<lb/>straight along the trail to O Bar O, shouting			
<lb/>in her clear, carrying young voice, the Indian			
<lb/>cry:</p>
            <p><q>Hi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yil Eee-yaw<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>aw-aw-aw-aw-aw!</q></p>
            <p>As she called, as she ran, an answering shout			
<lb/>came from the direction of the ranch, still			
<lb/>more than a mile away; but he who had an<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>swered her call for help was even then coming			
<lb/>over the crest of the last hill, and the silhouette			
<lb/>in the twilight of man and horse stopped the			
<lb/>girl short and sent her heart racing like a mad			
<lb/>thing in her breast. He was riding as only one			
<lb/>at O Bar O could ride. Reining up sharply			
<lb/>before Hilda, Cheerio swiftly dismounted and			
<lb/>was at her side.</p>
            <p><q>Hilda! You’ve been thrown!</q></p>
            <p>Oh, how that voice, with its unmistakable</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>note of deep anxiety in her behalf, made			
<lb/>Hilda’s heart leap. Even in her excitement,			
<lb/>she was conscious of a strangely exultant pang			
<lb/>at the thought that he should have been the one			
<lb/>to have come to her in her need. She could			
<lb/>scarcely speak from the excitement and terror			
<lb/>of her recent experience, and for the tumul<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tuous emotions at the sight of the man she			
<lb/>loved.</p>
            <p><q>Over there—a man! He followed me—Oh			
<lb/>-——has been trailing me through the woods, and			
<lb/>at the gate—the gate—he threw the lariat—			
<lb/>the lariat!</q></p>
            <p>Her voice rose hysterically.</p>
            <p><q>Tt missed us—just touched Daisy. I—I—			
<lb/>tied it to the gate post. Gate’s closed. He			
<lb/>can’t come through on horse. Look! There			
<lb/>he is! There he is! See—see—white chaps!			
<lb/>Look!</q></p>
            <p>She was speaking in little sobbing gasps,			
<lb/>conscicus not of the fact that she was held in			
<lb/>the comforting curve of the man’s strong arm.</p>
            <p>Dimly the vanishing form of horse and man			
<lb/>showed for an instant in the half light and dis-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 270 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>appeared into the dense woods beyond.			
<lb/>Cheerio made a motion as if to remount and			
<lb/>follow, but Hilda clung to his sleeve.</p>
            <p><q>Oh, don’t leave me. Please don’t leave me.			
<lb/>I’m—I’m—afraid to be alone</q></p>
            <p><q>N-not f-for worlds</q>, he said, <q>but			
<lb/>d-d-dear—</q> ‘Through all her pain she heard			
<lb/>that soft term of endearment, <q>He’s left the			
<lb/>lariat. Couldn’t stop to get it. Come, we'll			
<lb/>getit. It may furnish a clue</q>.</p>
            <p>Back at the gate, they untied the knotted			
<lb/>lariat and Cheerio recoiled it and attached it			
<lb/>to his own saddle.</p>
            <p><q>We'll keep this as a memento. Maybe			
<lb/>there’s a man at O Bar O short a Jariat</q>.</p>
            <p><q>No man at O Bar O would do a coyote’s

            <p>She had recovered somewhat of her com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>posure, though she still felt the near influence			
<lb/>of the man walking beside her, leading his			
<lb/>horse with one hand, and holding her arm with			
<lb/>the other. Her own mount had gone free and			
<lb/>would not be recovered till the morning. She</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>would not follow his suggestion to mount his			
<lb/>horse.</p>
            <p>And so they came down over the hill to<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gether. Just before they passed into the ranch			
<lb/>yard, Cheerio controlled his fluttering tongue			
<lb/>and stammered something that he had been			
<lb/>trying to say to her all of the way down the			
<lb/>hill.</p>
            <p><q>Hilda, I'm a f-f-f-fortunate d-dog. I’m			
<lb/>jolly glad I w-w-went out to look for you to<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>Now they were at the steps of the ranch			
<lb/>house. Hilda went up one step, paused, went			
<lb/>up another and stopped, unable to go further.			
<lb/>Cheerio leaned up and tried to see her face in			
<lb/>the semi-light that was now silvering the land			
<lb/>from the broad moon above. What he saw in			
<lb/>Hilda’s face brought the word bursting to his			
<lb/>lips:</p>
            <p><q>M-my dear old girl!</q> he said. <q>I’m dashed

            <p>And then she fled—fled in panic-stricken re<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>to her room, and cast herself down upon her

            <p>With the thought of his past, came irre<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sistibly back to torment her the woman of the			
<lb/>locket—‘‘Nanna, for whom he had come to			
<lb/>Canada to make a home. She had never been			
<lb/>wholly absent from Hilda’s thought and un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>consciously now, as in the midst of her bliss			
<lb/>she came back vividly to mind, a little sob			
<lb/>escaped her. She tried to fight the encroach<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing thought of this woman’s claim.</p>

<lb/>ing her.</p>
            <p>Suppose, however, they were engaged.			
<lb/>That was a word that was followed by mar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>triage. This thought sent Hilda to her feet,			
<lb/>stiff with a new alarm. The unquiet demon			
<lb/>of Jealousy had struck its fangs deep into the			
<lb/>girl’s innermost heart. She no sooner tried to			
<lb/>recall his face as he had looked at her in the			
<lb/>moonlight, the warm clasp of his hand, the			
<lb/>term of endearment that had slipped from his			
<lb/>lips, when the knife was twisted again within			
<lb/>her, and she saw the lovely face of the other			
<lb/>‘woman smiling at her from the gold locket,			
<lb/>with her fair hair enshrined on the opposite			
<lb/>side.</p>
            <p>The recollection was intolerable—unendur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able to one of Hilda’s tempestuous nature.			
<lb/>Suppose she should come to Alberta! Per<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>sired it! Suppose she should come even to

            <p>meet her? Her wild imagination pictured			
<lb/>the arrival, and Hilda began to walk her floor.			
<lb/>Love was now a purgatory. What was she to			
<lb/>do? What was she to do? Hilda asked her<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>self this question over and over again, and			
<lb/>then when her pain became more than she			
<lb/>could bear, she turned desperately to her door.			
<lb/>At any cost, however humiliating to her pride,			
<lb/>she would learn the truth. She would go di<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rectly to him. She would ask him point-blank			
<lb/>whether from this time on it was to be her or			
<lb/>—Nanna!</p>
            <p>She had done without her dinner. She			
<lb/>could not have eaten had she been able to force			
<lb/>herself to the table. Her father had called			
<lb/>her, Sandy had pounded upon her door. It			
<lb/>mattered not. Hilda was deaf to all summons,			
<lb/>save those clamouring ones within her.</p>
            <p>As far as that goes, she was not the only one			
<lb/>at O Bar O who had gone supperless.</p>
            <p>Cheerio, after she had left him, remained			
<lb/>at the foot of the steps, just looking up at the			
<lb/>door through which the world for him seemed			
<lb/>to have vanished. How long he stood thus,</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>cannot be estimated by minutes or seconds.			
<lb/>Presently he sat down upon the steps, and soon			
<lb/>was lost in a blissful daze of abstraction.</p>
            <p>Above him spread the great map of the			
<lb/>skies, at this time of year especially beautiful,			
<lb/>star-spotted and slashed with the long rays of			
<lb/>Northern lights and the night rainbows. Still			
<lb/>and electric was the night. Keen and fresh			
<lb/>the air. The ranch sounds were like mellow			
<lb/>musical echoes. Even the clang of Chum			
<lb/>Lee’s cow-bell, calling all hands to the evening			
<lb/>meal, seemed part of the all-abiding charm of			
<lb/>that perfect night.</p>
            <p>The voices of the men en route from bunk<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>house to cook-car, the sharp bark of the dog			
<lb/>Viper, and the answering growls of the cattle			
<lb/>dogs, the coyote, still wailing wildly in the			
<lb/>hills.</p>
            <p>Lights were low in the bunkhouse and on			
<lb/>full in the cook-car. The absorbing job of			
<lb/><q>feeding</q> was now in process.</p>
            <p>All these things Cheerio noted vaguely,			
<lb/>with a gentle sort of delight and approval.			
<lb/>They were all part of the general beauty of</p>

            <p>life on this remarkable ranch. He was con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>scious of a big, uplifting sense. He wanted to			
<lb/>shout across the world praise of this new land			
<lb/>that he had discovered; of the utter peace and			
<lb/>joy of ranching in the foothills of the Rocky			
<lb/>Mountains; of the girl of girls who was more			
<lb/>to him now than anything else on earth.</p>
            <p>A wide moon was now overhead, and the			
<lb/>country was bathed in a silvery light. The			
<lb/>skies were star-spotted, and alive with mystery			
<lb/>and beauty.</p>
            <p>Snatches of poetry sang in his head, and for			
<lb/>the first time since the days when he had			
<lb/>penned his boyish love lyrics to Sybil Chenno<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>weth, Cheerio indited new ones to Hilda, the			
<lb/>girl he now loved:</p>
            <p><q>Oh, Hilda, my darling, the sky is alive,			
<lb/>And all of the stars are above;			
<lb/>The moon in her gown of silvery sheen—			
<lb/>She knows of my love—my love</q>.</p>
            <p>It mattered not to the lover whether his			
<lb/>verses were of a high order from a critical</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 279 ]</fw>
            <pb n="280"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>point of view. They were heartfelt—an ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pression of what seemed surging up within			
<lb/>him. He needed a medium through which he			
<lb/>might speak to Hilda. On the back of an			
<lb/>envelope, he scratched:</p>
            <p><q>Hilda of the dark brown eyes			
<lb/>And lips so ripe and red</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda, of the wilful ways,</p>
            <p>And small, proud, tossing head.</p>
            <p>And so it went. But, like Hilda, the first			
<lb/>incoherent rhapsody gave way presently to			
<lb/>soberer thoughts. He was inspired by a de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sire to do something to prove himself worthy			
<lb/>of the girl he loved. He was overtaken with			
<lb/>an appalling realization of his shortcomings.			
<lb/>What had he to offer Hilda? What had he			
<lb/>done to deserve her? He was but one of			
<lb/>twenty or more paid <q>hands</q> on her father’s			
<lb/>ranch. He was penniless; nameless!</p>
            <p>She was no ordinary girl. That brown-eyed			
<lb/>girl, with her independent toss of head and			
<lb/>her free, frank nature, he knew had the ten-</p>

            <p>der heart of a mother. Cheerio had watched			
<lb/>many a time when she knew it not. He had			
<lb/>seen her with the baby colts, the calves, the			
<lb/>young live-stock of the ranch; the hidden			
<lb/>litter of kittens in the barn, whose existence			
<lb/>was so carefully hidden from her father. He			
<lb/>had watched Hilda caring for the sick little			
<lb/>Indian papoose, wrapping antiseptic salve			
<lb/>bandages on a little boy’s sore arm, and stoop<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing to kiss the brown face and pat the shoulder			
<lb/>of the little Indian mother. No wonder she			
<lb/>was adored by half the country-side. No			
<lb/>wonder the Indians called her <q>little mother</q>			
<lb/>and friend. She was as straightforward, hon<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>est, and clean as a whistle. She was fearless			
<lb/>and fine as a soldier. There was about her			
<lb/>slim, young grace a boyish air of courage.			
<lb/>Hilda! There never was another girl like his			
<lb/>in all the whole world.</p>
            <p>Now Cheerio felt humbled, unworthy.			
<lb/>Followed a boyish desire to give Hilda things.			
<lb/>He regretted his poverty, and suffered a sense			
<lb/>of resentment and irritation for the first time			
<lb/>at the thought of the power and pride of a</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 281 ]</fw>

            <p>great family name that should by rights be			
<lb/>his and Hilda’s. What had he to offer her?			
<lb/>Nothing—but the trifling trinket, a family			
<lb/>heirloom, in which long since he had replaced			
<lb/>the picture of the English girl with the one			
<lb/>Sandy had given him of Hilda. Automati<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cally his hand closed about the locket. It was			
<lb/>a fine old antique. Hilda would appreciate			
<lb/>it. He would show her her own and Nanna’s			
<lb/>face inside it. He pictured her shining eyes			
<lb/>as she would take the trinket from his hand.			
<lb/>Once she had told him she possessed not a			
<lb/>single piece of jewellery. P. D. had de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nounced them as <q>baubles, suitable for sav<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ages only—relics of days of barbarism. The

<lb/>P. D. McPherson, <q>and hung silly stones			
<lb/>from them was little better than the half-naked			
<lb/>black women who hung jewels and rings from			
<lb/>their noses</q>.</p>
            <p>But Hilda did not share her father’s opin<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ion. She had spoken wistfully, longingly, en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>viously. This was after reading a chapter</p>

            <p>concerning Anne of Austria’s diamonds and			
<lb/>D’Artagnan’s famous recovery of the same.</p>
            <p>Well, Hilda should have her first piece of			
<lb/>jewellery from his hands. The ancient Chels<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>As a boy, Cheerio’s inability swiftly to ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>plain or defend himself, had resulted in many			
<lb/>unjust punishments. He was not stupid, but			
<lb/>became easily confused, and with the best of			
<lb/>intentions, he bungled into unfortunate situa<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tions. His brother, Reggie, swift-witted and			
<lb/>glib of tongue, was far better equipped to de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fend and care for himself than the often be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>wildered and stammering Cheerio. He had			
<lb/>changed very little, and his love had made

            <p>As he hurried eagerly across the verandah			
<lb/>to meet Hilda who was hastening in her direct

<lb/>the intended gift.</p>
            <p>In the bright moonlight, Hilda saw the

<lb/>her impetuous approach. Speech at that mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>choked, struck, and her heart was beating so			
<lb/>riotously that it hurt her physically. A primi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tive surge of wild, ungovernable rage surged			
<lb/>up within her.</p>
            <p>In a far worse dilemma was the unfortu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nate and deluded and misunderstood Cheerio.			
<lb/>At that psychological moment, when he would			
<lb/>have given his life for eloquent speech in			
<lb/>which to tell the girl before him of his love,			
<lb/>he was overtaken with panic and confusion.			
<lb/>The hostile attitude of the girl reduced him to			
<lb/>a state of incoherent stuttering as he continued			
<lb/>foolishly to extend the locket.</p>
            <p><q/><q>W w-w-w-w-w-w-w: </q></p>

            <p>Like a tidal wave, the girl’s anger over<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>whelmed her. Hell, which the proverb as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sures us, hath no fury like a woman scorned,			
<lb/>raged indeed in the ungoverned breast of the			
<lb/>girl of the ranching country. She was neither			
<lb/>equipped by nature or training with those			
<lb/>feminine defenses that might have shielded			
<lb/>her. She was in a way as uncivilized as the			
<lb/>savage woman who beats her untrue mate. All			
<lb/>she was fiercely conscious of was her raging			
<lb/>indignation at the imagined affront offered			
<lb/>her by Cheerio. He, who but a short time			
<lb/>since she had been deluded enough to believe			
<lb/>actually loved her was now flaunting before			
<lb/>her that hateful locket in which she knew was			
<lb/>the picture of the woman he had come to			
<lb/>Canada to make a home for.</p>
            <p>Her eyes were aflame. Her anger domi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nated her entirely.</p>
            <p>Crestfallen and surprised, Cheerio drew			
<lb/>back a pace:</p>
            <p><q>T s-say</q>,’ he persisted stupidly, <q>I only

            <p><q>How dare you offer me a thing like that?</q>			
<lb/>demanded Hilda, in a level, deadly voice.			
<lb/><q>Flow dare you! How dare you!</q></p>
            <p>Her voice rose. She stamped her foot. Her			
<lb/>hands clinched. It would have relieved her			
<lb/>to hurt him physically. Surprised and de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>jected, he turned away, but his movement			
<lb/>whetted her anger. Her fiery words pursued			
<lb/>him.</p>
            <p><q>What do you take me for? Do you think			
<lb/>I want your silly old second-hand jewellery?			
<lb/>Why don’t you wrap the precious thing up in			
<lb/>white tissue paper and send it across the sea			
<lb/>to the woman that’s in it?</q></p>
            <p>At that a light of understanding broke over			
<lb/>Cheerio. He moved impetuously toward her:</p>
            <p><q>Hilda, don’t you know that you—you</q></p>
            <p>’</p>
            <p>are ,</p>
            <p>He got no further, for at that moment a loud			
<lb/>cough behind him interrupted him. In their			
<lb/>excitement neither Hilda nor Cheerio had			
<lb/>noted the car ascending the grade to the ranch			
<lb/>and then circling the path. Duncan Mallison			
<lb/>had come up the stairs and across the verandah</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 287 ]</fw>
            <pb n="288"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>and had coughed loudly before either Cheerio			
<lb/>or Hilda were aware of his presence.</p>
            <p><q>Good evening, everybody</q>, said the news<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>paper man. <q>How’s chess?</q></p>
            <p>Cheerio had recovered himself sufficiently			
<lb/>to return the grip of the other’s hand.</p>
            <p><q>Why, hello!</q></p>
            <p>Mallison chuckled.</p>
            <p><q>Didn’t expect to see me back, did you? I'll

<lb/>Well, Munns—our city editor—thinks he can			
<lb/>make a place for you.</p>
            <p>It was the snapping closed of the door that			
<lb/>apprised them of the departure of Hilda.			
<lb/>Cheerio looked at it thoughtfully, with an ele<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p><q>Took here</q>, he said to his friend. ‘<q>You’ve

            <p><q>Father</q>, but she believed herself to be in a			
<lb/>desperate situation and desperate speech and			
<lb/>measures were necessary. <q>Father, you have			
<lb/>simply got to beat him to-night. You-——</q></p>
            <p><q>You leave the room, miss</q>,</p>
            <p><q>Dad, I </q></p>

            <p><q>Oh, if you only knew how unhappy I am</q>,			
<lb/>cried Hilda piteously. Her father took her			
<lb/>by the shoulders and turned her bodily out,			
<lb/>closing the door sharply between them, and</p>
            <p>returning to pace the floor of his own office,			
<lb/>and work off some of the upsetting influences			
<lb/>which might not be well for that calmness and			
<lb/>poise of mind necessary for a game of chess.</p>
            <p>The ranch house was a great, unwieldy			
<lb/>building, with a wide hall dividing on one side			
<lb/>the enormous living-room and on the other the			
<lb/>dining-room, beyond which was P. D.’s office			
<lb/>and study.</p>
            <p>Hilda shot out of her father’s office into the			
<lb/>darkened dining-room, and from there into			
<lb/>the lighted hall, where she collided with the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 293 J</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>entering Cheerio. On him, she turned the			
<lb/>last vials of her wrath.</p>
            <p><q>I’ve something to say to you. Everything			
<lb/>on this ranch is at a standstill on your account.			
<lb/>If we don’t gather in our cattle soon, there'll			
<lb/>be a lot of lost and dead O Bar O stock when			
<lb/>the first blizzard comes. I wish you’d never			
<lb/>come here. You've pulled my old Dad down,			
<lb/>and look what you’ve done to me—look!—I’m			
<lb/>glad you’re going away! I don’t want ever to			
<lb/>see your face again!</q></p>
            <p>Even as she said the words, Hilda longed to			
<lb/>recall them. Cheerio’s hurt look was more			
<lb/>than she could bear, and she fled up the stairs			
<lb/>like one pursued. He heard the bang of her			
<lb/>door, and a strangely softened look stole into			
<lb/>his face as he turned into the living-room.</p>
            <p>The chess board was still set up, the men			
<lb/>standing on the positions of the previous night,			
<lb/>when the game had remained unfinished at the			
<lb/>ending hour of ten o’clock. Cheerio cast a			
<lb/>swift glance about him, studied the board a			
<lb/>moment, and then with another furtive glance,			
<lb/>quickly changed the position of a Black Queen</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 294 ]</fw>
            <pb n="295"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>and a White Pawn. His hand was scarcely off			
<lb/>the board when Hilda McPherson slipped			
<lb/>from between the portieres.</p>
            <p>As swiftly and passionately as she had fled			
<lb/>up the stairs, so she had run down again, com-</p>
            <p>punction overwhelming her, torn and troubled			
<lb/>by that look on the man’s face. But her reac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tion turned to amazement and indignant scorn			
<lb/>as she watched him at the chess board. If she			
<lb/>had repented her harsh treatment of him be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fore, now, more than ever, she ascended in			
<lb/>judgment upon him. His glance fell guiltily			
<lb/>before her accusing one. Hilda seized upon			
<lb/>the first word that came to her tongue, regard<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>less of its odiousness.</p>
            <p><q>Cheat! Cheat! Now I understnd how			
<lb/>you’ve been beating my Dad! You’ve been			
<lb/>changing the positions. You can’t deny itl			
<lb/>I’ve caught you red-handed. Oh, oh! I

<lb/>discover you’re not only a——</q></p>
            <p>He flinched, almost as if physically struck,			
<lb/>and turned white. Then his face stiffened.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 295 ]</fw>
            <pb n="296"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>His heels came together with that peculiarly			
<lb/>little military click that was characteristic of			
<lb/>him when moved. His face was masklike as			
<lb/>he stared straight at Hilda. Something in his			
<lb/>silence, some element of loneliness and help<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lessness about this man clutched at the stormy			
<lb/>heart of the girl, and stopped the words upon			
<lb/>her lips, as her father came into the room.			
<lb/>Hilda had the strange feeling of a wild mother			
<lb/>at bay. Angry with her child, she yet was			
<lb/>ready to fight for and defend it. All uncon<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sciously, she had covered her lips with her			
<lb/>hands to crush back the hot words that were			
<lb/>surging up to expose him to her father.</p>
            <p><q>What’s this? Why so much excitement?			
<lb/>Why all this hysterical waste of force? It car<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ried even to my office—electrical waves of

<lb/>at the bunkhouse or the barns. I'll make a			
<lb/>test some day. Sit down, sit down. If you			
<lb/>wish to witness our game, oblige us with			
<lb/>silence, if you please</q>.</p>
            <p>To Cheerio he said:</p>

            <p>citement of my daughter. Youth is life’s			
<lb/>tempestuous period—hard to govern—hard to			
<lb/>restrain, a pathological, problematical time of			
<lb/>life. Be seated, sir. My move, I believe, sir.</p>
            <p>Hilda felt weak and curiously broken. She			
<lb/>sat forward in her chair, her eyes so dark and			
<lb/>large that her face, no longer rosy, seemed now			
<lb/>peculiarly small and young.</p>
            <p>Old P. D. scratched his chin and pinched			
<lb/>his lower lip as he examined the board through			
<lb/>his glasses. Cheerio was not looking at the			
<lb/>board, his sad, somewhat stern glance was			
<lb/>pinned upon Hilda.</p>
            <p>There was a pause, and suddenly P. D.’s			
<lb/>face jerked forward. A crafty twitch of the			
<lb/>left eyebrow. He glanced up at Cheerio,			
<lb/>moved a Bishop three paces to the right.			
<lb/>Cheerio withdrew his eyes reluctantly from			
<lb/>the drooping Hilda, looked absently at the			
<lb/>board and made the obvious move. Instantly			
<lb/>P. D.’s hand shot toward his Queen. A pause,			
<lb/>and then suddenly through the room, like the			
<lb/>pop of a gun, P. D.’s shout resounded :</p>
            <p><q>Check!</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 297 ]</fw>
            <pb n="298"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Pause.</p>
            <p><q>Check!</q></p>
            <p>This time louder.</p>
            <p><q>Check to your King, sir! Game! Game!</q>			
<lb/>Up leaped P. D. McPherson, sprang toward			
<lb/>his opponent, smashed him upon the shoulder,			
<lb/>gripped him by both hands, and shouted:</p>
            <p><q>Beat youl! By Gad! Id rather beat you			
<lb/>than go to Chicago. Damn your hands and			
<lb/>feet, you’re a dashed damned fine player, and			
<lb/>it’s an honour to beat you, sir! Come along			
<lb/>with me, sir!</q></p>
            <p>He dragged his opponent out, and arm and			
<lb/>arm they hurried across to the bunkhouse to			
<lb/>proclaim the <q>damnfine news</q> and to order all			
<lb/>hands of the O Bar O to set out on the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing morning upon that annual Fall round-up			
<lb/>which had been put off for so long. But be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fore Cheerio had left the room, and even while			
<lb/>her father was all but embracing him, his			
<lb/>glance had gone straight into the eyes of Hilda,			
<lb/>pale as death and slowly arising.</p>
            <p>Like one moving in sleep, feeling her way			
<lb/>as she passed, Hilda McPherson followed her</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 298 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>father and Cheerio. But she could go no far<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ther than the verandah. There she sat			
<lb/>crouched down on the steps, her face in her			
<lb/>hands, overwhelmed by the unbearable pain			
<lb/>that seemed to clutch at her heart. The truth			
<lb/>had shocked Hilda into a realization of the			
<lb/>inexcusable wrong and insult that she had			
<lb/>dealt to this man. No words were needed.			
<lb/>She comprehended exactly what had happened</p>
            <p>in that room. Cheerio, she now knew, had			
<lb/>changed the men on the board for her father’s			
<lb/>advantage. And she had called him a cheat!</p>
            <p>She took her hands down from her face, and			
<lb/>spoke the words aloud:</p>
            <p><q>T called him a cheat! I called him a—			
<lb/>coward! Oh, what am I to dor</q></p>
            <p>The man who had been sitting in the swing<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing couch, and whom she had not seen, strolled			
<lb/>across the verandah and came directly down			
<lb/>the steps to where the unhappy Hilda was			
<lb/>crouched.</p>
            <p><q>Miss McPherson! Can I do anything for			
<lb/>your</q></p>
            <p>Hilda was in too much pain to feel either</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 299 J</fw>

            <p>surprise or resentment for the intrusion. She			
<lb/>said piteously:</p>
            <p><q>T called him a cheat! a coward!</q></p>
            <p><q>A coward—him/</q></p>
            <p>Duncan Mallison’s face darkened with an			
<lb/>almost angry red.</p>
            <p><q>You may as well know this much at least</q>,			
<lb/>he said roughly. <q>The man you called a			
<lb/>coward won the Victoria Cross for an act of			
<lb/>sublime heroism during the war</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda stood up. She looked beaten and			
<lb/>small. She was wrenching her hands to<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gether as she backed toward the door. Her			
<lb/>lips were quivering. She tried to speak, but			
<lb/>the words could not come, and she shook her			
<lb/>head dumbly.</p>
            <p>The reporter, who probably understood hu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man nature far better than the average per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>son, was touched by the girl’s evident misery.			
<lb/>He put his hand under Hilda’s arm, and			
<lb/>guided her to the door. There he said sooth<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ingly:</p>
            <p><q>Now, don’t worry. Everything’s all right,

<lb/>So, don’t worry. First thing in the morning

<lb/>pressing her hands to her eyes. Slowly, pain<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fully, she recalled the events of the previous			
<lb/>night.</p>
            <p>She had called him a cheat—a coward! She			
<lb/>had said that she never wished to see his face			
<lb/>again! She had driven him from O Bar O.			
<lb/>He had gone out of her life now forever.</p>
            <p>Hilda could see the dim light of the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>proaching dawn already tinting the wide east<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ern sky. It was a chill, raw morning. -He			
<lb/>would walk out from O Bar O, with his old,			
<lb/>battered grip in his hand and that gray suit			
<lb/>that had so edified the ranch hands. Her			
<lb/>breast rose and swelled. The tears of the			
<lb/>previous night threatened to overwhelm her			
<lb/>again. Hilda had literally cried practically			
<lb/>all of the night, and her hour’s sleep had come			
<lb/>only through sheer exhaustion.</p>
            <p>The unhappy girl crept out of bed and knelt</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 302 }</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>by the window, peering out in the first grey			
<lb/>gloom of the Autumn morning, toward the			
<lb/>bunkhouse. She fancied she saw something			
<lb/>moving in that direction, but the light was			
<lb/>dim, and she could not be sure.</p>
            <p>It was cold and damp as she knelt on the			
<lb/>floor. No matter. He would be cold and			
<lb/>chilled, too, and she had driven him from O			
<lb/>Bar O!</p>
            <p>A light gleamed now in the dusk over at the			
<lb/>saddle rooms. A glance at her watch showed			
<lb/>it was not yet six o’clock. He would make an			
<lb/>early start, probably leaving before the men			
<lb/>started off on the round-up—they were to			
<lb/>leave for the range at seven that morning.</p>
            <p>Without quite realizing what she was doing,			
<lb/>Hilda dressed swiftly. The cold water on her			
<lb/>tear-blistered face soothed and cooled it. She			
<lb/>wrapped a cape about herself, put on a knitted			
<lb/>tam.</p>
            <p>The halls were dark, but she dared not turn			
<lb/>on the electric lights, lest she should awaken			
<lb/>Sandy or her father. Feeling her way along			
<lb/>the wall, she found the stairs, and clinging to</p>

            <p>the bannister went quickly down. A moment			
<lb/>to seek the door knob, and swing the big door			
<lb/>open. At last she was out of the house.</p>
            <p>The cold air smote:and revived her. It			
<lb/>gave her courage and strength.</p>
            <p>The darkness was slowly lifting, and all			
<lb/>over the sky the silvery waves of morning were			
<lb/>now spreading. Hilda sped like a fawn across			
<lb/>the barn yard, through the corrals and directly			
<lb/>to the saddle room, from whence came the			
<lb/>light. The upper part of the door was open,			
<lb/>and Hilda pushed the lower part and stepped			
<lb/>inside.</p>
            <p>A man in white chaps was bending over a			
<lb/>saddle to which he was attaching a lariat rope.			
<lb/>As the lower door slammed shut behind Hilda,			
<lb/>he started like an overtaken thief, and jumped			
<lb/>around. Hilda saw his face. It was Holy			
<lb/>Smoke.</p>
            <p>All at once Hilda McPherson knew that			
<lb/>before her stood the man who had tried to			
<lb/>lariat her in the woods. She stared at him now			
<lb/>in a sort of fascinated horror. A cunning look			
<lb/>of surprised delight was creeping over the</p>

            <pb n="305"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>man’s face. Hilda put her hand behind her			
<lb/>and backed for the door. At the same time,			
<lb/>once again she raised her voice, and sent forth			
<lb/>that loud cry of alarm:</p>
            <p><q>Hi-yi-yi-yi-yl-yi-yi-itiii-i-i-i-i!l</q></p>
            <p>The cry was choked midway. She was held			
<lb/>in a strangling hold, the big hand of the cow<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>puncher gripped upon her throat.</p>
            <p><q>There'll be none of the Hi-yi-ing for you			
<lb/>to-day! If you make another peep, I’ll choke			
<lb/>you to death! I’m quittin’ O Bar O for good

<lb/>got an account to settle</q>.</p>
            <p>She fought desperately, with all her splen<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>did young strength, scratching, kicking, biting,			
<lb/>beating with her fists like a wild thing at bay,			
<lb/>and, with the first release as he staggered back,			
<lb/>when her sharp teeth dug into his hands, again			
<lb/>she raised her voice; but this time her cry was			
<lb/>stopped by the brutal blow of the man’s fist.			
<lb/>She clutched at the wall behind her. The			
<lb/>earth seemed to rock and sway and for the first			
<lb/>time in all her healthy young life, Hilda Mc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>Pherson fainted.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 305 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>She lay on a sheepskin, a man’s coat beneath			
<lb/>her head. Chum Lee knelt beside her, cup in			
<lb/>hand. She swallowed with difficulty, for her			
<lb/>throat pained her and she still felt the grip of			
<lb/>those terrible fingers. Hilda moaned and			
<lb/>moved her head from side to side. The			
<lb/>Chinaman said cheerfully:</p>
            <p><q>All lightee now, Miss Hilda. Chum Lee			
<lb/>flix ’im fine. Slut ’im. Bang ’im. Slut ’im

<lb/>Cheerio. Velly good, now lide on Jail</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda understood only that Holy Smoke			
<lb/>had shot Cheerio.</p>
            <p>She clutched the Chinaman’s arm, and			
<lb/>forced herself to her feet. Pushing Chum Lee			
<lb/>aside, Hilda made her way from the saddle			
<lb/>shed, where they had laid her.</p>
            <p>Outside, the sharp cold air of the Fall morn<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing was like a dash of bitter water and brought			
<lb/>its revivifying effect. Hilda turned in the di<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rection of the voice she now heard clearly, for			
<lb/>sound carries far in a country like Alberta,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 306 ]</fw>
            <pb n="307"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>and although Hilda could clearly hear the			
<lb/>voices of the men, they were in fact more than			
<lb/>a mile from the ranch. She was obsessed with			
<lb/>the idea that Cheerio had been killed and that			
<lb/>her men had taken his murderer into the			
<lb/>woods and were hanging him. Oh! she			
<lb/>wanted a hand in that hanging. Everything			
<lb/>primitive and wild in her nature surged now			
<lb/>into being, as she made her way blindly down</p>
            <p>that incredibly long hill and ran stumblingly			
<lb/>through the pasture lands to where the group			
<lb/>of men were about some strange object that			
<lb/>was tied and bound half sitting on a rail.			
<lb/>Then Hilda understood, and waves of unholy			
<lb/>joy swept over her in a flood. They were tar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ring and feathering Holy Smoke!</p>
            <p>Above the deafening roar of the cheering			
<lb/>shouting voices, presently rose the clear call			
<lb/>of the one she knew. No fluttering, stammer<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing tongue now. The voice of a captain, a			
<lb/>leader among men:</p>
            <p><q>One, two, three! In she goes!</q></p>
            <p>The rail was swung back and forth, and at			
<lb/>that <q>Three</q>, with a roar from twenty or</p>

            <p>thirty throats, it was released from the hands			
<lb/>gripping it at either end and plunged into the			
<lb/>muddy water of the shallow slough. It de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>scribed a somersault. Head downward went			
<lb/>the man they had tarred and feathered. The			
<lb/>rail jerked over, and the head of Holy Smoke			
<lb/>arose out of the water, a grotesque paste of			
<lb/>mud and tar covering it completely. Loud			
<lb/>shouts of glee arose from the men. They			
<lb/>jeered and yelled to the struggling wretch in</p>
            <p>the water.</p>
            <p>From the direction of the ranch, came the			
<lb/>sound of the loud clanking breakfast bell of			
<lb/>Chum Lee. In high good humour, with appe<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tites whetted and vengeance satisfied, the men			
<lb/>of O Bar O retraced their steps toward the			
<lb/>ranch, prepared for that hearty breakfast			
<lb/>which should stiffen them against the invigor<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ating work of at last rounding up.</p>
            <p>Cheerio alone remained by the slough, and			
<lb/>Hilda, watching him from the little clump of			
<lb/>bush, witnessed a strange and merciful act on			
<lb/>his part; the sort of thing a man: of Cheerio’s			
<lb/>type was accustomed to do at the front, when</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 308 ]</fw>
            <pb n="309"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>an enemy, hors de combat, needed final suc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cour. Cheerio thrust two long logs into the			
<lb/>mud of the slough, very much as he had done			
<lb/>when he had rescued the heifer in the woods.			
<lb/>Now also he went out across the logs and cut			
<lb/>the ropes that bound the man to the rail.			
<lb/>Holy Smoke grasped after the logs, clung to			
<lb/>them desperately, and Cheerio gave his stiff			
<lb/>order to him to get off the place as expedi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tiously as possible if he valued his hide.</p>
            <p>Having set the man free, Cheerio returned			
<lb/>to the bank, stopped to clean the mud off his			
<lb/>boots with a handy stick and then moved to			
<lb/>follow after the men, now at a considerable			
<lb/>distance.</p>
            <p>Hilda, her blue and red cape flapping back			
<lb/>from her as she came from the little bush to<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward him, was holding out both her hands, but			
<lb/>as Cheerio stopped short they dropped help<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lessly at her side. His grave eyes slowly trav<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>elled over the piteous little figure in his path.			
<lb/>The eyes that had been so stern now softened,			
<lb/>but Cheerio could not speak at that moment.			
<lb/>Something rose in his throat and held him</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 309 ]</fw>
            <pb n="310"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>spellbound, looking at the girl he loved and			
<lb/>whom he had expected never to see again.			
<lb/>Hilda’s eyes were unnaturally wide and dark;			
<lb/>her lips were as tremulous as a flower and			
<lb/>quivering like those of a hurt child. The flag			
<lb/>of hostility and hate was down forever. She			
<lb/>was pathetic and most lovely in her humility.</p>
            <p>Cheerio murmured something unintelligible			
<lb/>and held out his arms to her. Hilda would			
<lb/>have gone indeed directly to that haven; but			
<lb/>there was Sandy racing along the trail on			
<lb/>Silver Heels, shouting like an Indian excited			
<lb/>queries and shrilly demanding to know why he			
<lb/>had been <q>left out of the fun</q>. Nevertheless,			
<lb/>Cheerio had sensed the unconscious motion of			
<lb/>the girl, and a light broke over his face, driv<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing away the last shadow. His wide, boyish			
<lb/>smile beamed down upon her. Speech failed			
<lb/>him not at that blessed moment.</p>
            <p><q>Darling!’ said Cheerio, in such a voice			
<lb/>that Hilda thought the word an even more			
<lb/>beautiful one than the </q><q>Dear</q> he had once			
<lb/>before called her.</p>
            <p><q>Hi, Hilday! What’s all the racket about?</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 310]</fw>
            <pb n="311"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>What they done to Ho? Whereis he? Dad’s			
<lb/>goin’ to kill °em. He’s gone plumb crazy at			
<lb/>the house. Chum Lee come on in an tol’ ’im			
<lb/>that he beat you up. Is that true?</p>
            <p>Cheerio answered for her.</p>
            <p><q>He’s a bad lot, Sandy, and he’s got his			
<lb/>deserts</q>. His eyes were still on Hilda. It			
<lb/>didn’t seem possible that he could withdraw			
<lb/>them. Over her pale cheeks a glow was com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing like the dawn, and her shy glance trembled			
<lb/>toward his own.</p>
            <p><q>My! Dad’s hoppin’ mad. Ses hangin’ ain’t			
<lb/>too good for him, the dirty dog, an I say it tool			
<lb/>What'd he do to youe What was you doin’ in			
<lb/>the barn at that hour?</q></p>
            <p>Hilda shook her head. Her eyes were shin<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing so that even Sandy was nonplussed.</p>
            <p><q>You don’t look beaten up</q>, said her			
<lb/>brother, and Hilda laughed and then unex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pectedly her eyes filled with tears and she			
<lb/>sobbed.</p>
            <p><q>Gee! I wish someone’d waked me up.			
<lb/>Doggone it, I don’t see why I was left out.			
<lb/>Wish I'd caught him hittin’ my sister! Dad’s</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[3]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>nearly crazy. You better hustle along home,			
<lb/>Hilda. You’d think you were the only person			
<lb/>at O Bar O now to hear Dad talk. He’s			
<lb/>thinkin’ up every mean thing he ever said to			
<lb/>you and he’s cryin’ like a baby.</p>
            <p><q>Poor old Dad!</q> said Hilda, softly.</p>
            <p>A movement on the edge of the slough now			
<lb/>attracted the incredulous eyes of Sandy Mc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>Pherson. He was shuffling into the clothes			
<lb/>left for him on the bank. Instantly Sandy had			
<lb/>reined up beside him. He yelled insults and			
<lb/>epithets down at the shivering wretch on the			
<lb/>bank, stuck his fingers into his mouth and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>duced a hooting whistle then Sandy played			
<lb/>at lariating the man, but Ho, with a venomous			
<lb/>look, grasped the rope as it fell in a ring near			
<lb/>him, and there was a tug of war for its posses<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sion between man and boy. Sandy let go the			
<lb/>rope and concentrated upon the nine foot long			
<lb/>bull whip in his other hand. Yelling to the			
<lb/>man to move along swiftly and to get <q>to hello</q>			
<lb/>off O Bar O, Hilda’s brother pursued her as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sailant.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Hilda and Cheerio seized the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[312]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>opportunity to continue that interrupted duo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>logue. He said suddenly, after a rapt mo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment:</p>
            <p><q>Hilda, you don’t hate me then, do you,			
<lb/>dear?</q></p>
            <p>In a little voice, Hilda said:</p>
            <p><q>No</q>.</p>
            <p><q>And you d-don’t want me to go away, do			
<lb/>your</q></p>
            <p>Hilda shook her head, too moved for more			
<lb/>speech, but her eyes brimmed at the mere			
<lb/>thought of his going. That was too much for			
<lb/>Cheerio, and regardless of Sandy, he took			
<lb/>Hilda’s hand.</p>
            <p><q>Then I'll stay</q>, he said, softly.</p>
            <p>Hand in hand, they were moving home<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward, walking in an entranced silence, the			
<lb/>glow of the early morning drawing them			
<lb/>under its golden spell; but before Sandy had			
<lb/>joined them, all that they had yearned to say			
<lb/>and hear was spoken.</p>
            <p><q>Hilda! I love youl</q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, do your Then—then—that Nanna—</q></p>
            <p><q>Nanna is seventy-four. My old nurse</q>,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 313 ]</fw>
            <pb n="314"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Hilda. When I returned from—Germany—			
<lb/>I was a prisoner there nine months, Hilda—			
<lb/>Nanna was the only one at home who knew me.			
<lb/>You see—you see—it was better that they			
<lb/>shouldn’t know me. M-m-my brother was in			
<lb/>my place. And you see, Hilda, I c-came out			
<lb/>here, and N-Nanna planned to f-follow me.			
<lb/>She is seventy-four.</p>
            <p><q>Seventy-four! Oh, I thought—-I thought			
<lb/>—that picture in the locket——</q></p>
            <p><q>That was Sybil—now my brother’s wife</q>.</p>
            <p>Wonderful things were happening to Hilda.			
<lb/>She wanted to laugh; she wanted to cry, and			
<lb/>the pink cheek wavered from him, and then			
<lb/>came to rest against his rough sleeve. Cheerio			
<lb/>never even glanced back to see if Sandy were			
<lb/>at hand. He placed his arm completely and			
<lb/>competently around Hilda’s waist. Their lips			
<lb/>were very close. This time it was Hilda who			
<lb/>whispered the words, and Cheerio bent so close			
<lb/>to hear them that his lips came upon her own.</p>
            <p><q>Oh, I loved you all the time!</q> said Hilda			
<lb/>McPherson.</p>
            <p>At this juncture, they stopped walking, for</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[314]</fw>
            <pb n="315"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>one may not kiss as satisfactorily while moving			
<lb/>along.</p>
            <p>When Hilda regained her power of speech,			
<lb/>she said:</p>
            <p><q>I’m never going to say another unkind</q></p>
            <p>thing to you.</p>
            <p><q>You can say anything you want, sweet<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>heart</q>, said Cheerio. <q>Whatever you say will			
<lb/>sound just right to me—dearest old girl</q>.</p>
            <p>It occurred to Hilda that he possessed a			
<lb/>most wonderful and extensive vocabulary.			
<lb/>She had never heard such terms before, and			
<lb/>when she had read them Hilda had felt em<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>barrassed, and in her rough way had thought:			
<lb/><q>Oh, slush!</q></p>
            <p>But somehow the words had an almost			
<lb/>lyrical sound when uttered by the infatuated			
<lb/>Cheerio.</p>
            <p>They were brought back to life by the yip<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ping, jeering Sandy.</p>
            <p><q>Geel I believe you two’s struck on each			
<lb/>other!</q></p>
            <p>He reined up beside them and examined the</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>telltale faces with all a boy’s cunning and dis- |			
<lb/>gusted amusement.</p>
            <p><q>Say, are you goin’ to git married?</q></p>
            <p><q>You better believe we are!</q> laughed			
<lb/>Cheerio, falling easily into the slang of the			
<lb/>country.</p>
            <p><q>Holy Salmon! Well, there’s no accountin’			
<lb/>for tastes</q>, said Hilda’s young brother, with			
<lb/>disparagement. ‘Then resignedly: <q>But, I			
<lb/>betchu Dad’ll be tickled. He’ll have a life			
<lb/>partner for chess. Geel Here’s where I			
<lb/>escape!</q></p>
            <p>He kicked his heels into his horse’s flanks			
<lb/>and with the grace and agility of a circus rider,			
<lb/>with neither saddle nor bridle merely a halter’			
<lb/>—Sandy was off. He turned bodily around in			
<lb/>his seat on the running horse’s back to yell			
<lb/>back at them as he rode, hand to mouth:</p>
            <p><q>Aw, cut out the spoons! I’m going to			
<lb/>hustle home and break the news to fa-ather!			
<lb/>Let ’er go, bronc! Let’er fly! Let ’er fly!</q></p>
            <p>They smiled after the vanishing boy, smiled			
<lb/>into each other’s faces and smiled at the sun<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>shine and the gilded hills, now shining in the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 316 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>full light of the marvellous Alberta sun.			
<lb/>After a moment, shyly, despite the fact that			
<lb/>she was held closely to him:</p>
            <p><q>What’s your real name?</q></p>
            <p><q>Edward Eaton Charlesmore of Maccles<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>field and Coventry</q>.</p>
            <p><q>You’re making fun of me</q>.</p>
            <p><q>N-no, I’m not, darling. That’s my real			
<lb/>name</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda smiled delightedly.</p>
            <p><q>But what do they call you?</q></p>
            <p>He laughed, squeezed her tightly, kissed her			
<lb/>and then kissed her again.			
<lb/>: <q>Cheerio!</q> he said.</p>
            <p><q>But that’s not a real name!</q></p>
            <p><q>Tt’s good enough for me. You gave me it,

            <p><q>And—and are you really a duke or some<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thing like that?</q></p>
            <p>Again he laughed.</p>
            <p><q>You bet I am</q>.</p>
            <p>Her face fell. She regretted his high estate.			
<lb/>Cheerio put his lips against her small pink</p>

            <p>ear, and he kissed it before he whispered what			
<lb/>he said was a great secret:</p>
