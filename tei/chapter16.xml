            <p><hi rendition="#smallcaps">BILL</hi> stretched his long neck, and			
<lb/>appeared to be troubled with his Adam’s ap<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ple. His eye did not meet the ireful one			
<lb/>of his employer.</p>
            <p><q>I came over to the house</q>, he repeated,			
<lb/>with elaborate casualness, <q>to tell you I’ve			
<lb/>fired his royal nibs</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Fired what? Who? The King of the			
<lb/>Jews or who in the name of chattering crows			
<lb/>do you meane</q></p>
            <p><q>And you come to me at the hour of two<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thirty in the afternoon to announce the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>charge of an employee of the O Bar O? Eh?</q></p>
            <p>‘<q/><q>Wa-al, I reckon, boss, that O Bar O can’t			
<lb/>afford to keep no white-livered hound in its			
<lb/>employ for even the rest of the day</q>.</p>
            <p>‘What crime has he committed?</p>
            <p><q>Well, it ain’t a crime exactly, but—well,			
<lb/>boss, I give him an easy job to do—a kid’s			
<lb/>job—Sandy could a done it, and I’m switched</q></p>

            <p>if he didn’t double over and faint dead away			
<lb/>at the first bat of the brand. Never seen noth<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing like it in my life. At the first sniff! Why,			
<lb/>a baby could </p>
            <p><q>Do you wish me to understand that you</q></p>
            <p>fired an employee of my ranch because he			
<lb/>had the temerity to be ://?</p>
            <p>His irritation, far from being appeased,			
<lb/>was steadily mounting.</p>
            <p><q>Dad</q>, interrupted Hilda, stepping for<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ward suddenly. <q>It wasn’t illness. It was			
<lb/>worse than that. It was plumb cowardice</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Cowardice! Look in the dictionary for			
<lb/>the proper definition of that word, young			
<lb/>woman. A man doesn’t faint from cowardice.			
<lb/>He runs away—hides—slinks off——</q></p>
            <p><q>That’s what he did—in France. He con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fessed it when he came to. Tried to excuse			
<lb/>himself by saying it was constitutional. Just			
<lb/>as if anyone could be a constitutional coward.			
<lb/>Bully Bill is right, Dad. O Bar O cannot			
<lb/>employ that kind of men</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Who is running this rancher</q> demanded			
<lb/>P. D., with rising wrath, thumping upon the</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>table, and upsetting the last of the chess men			
<lb/>and then the table itself.</p>
            <p><q>But, Dad </q></p>
            <p><q>Silence!</q></p>
            <p>Mutinously, the girl stood her ground,			
<lb/>catching her breath in sobbing excitement.</p>
            <p><q>But, Dad, you don’t understand </q></p>
            <p><q>One more word from you, miss, and you			
<lb/>leave the room. One more word, and we'll			
<lb/>cut out the gymkhanna at Grand Valley next			
<lb/>week</q>.</p>
            <p>Turning to the foreman:</p>
            <p><q>Now, sir, explain yourself—explain the			
<lb/>meaning of this damnation, unwarranted in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>trusion into my house</q>.</p>
            <p>Slowly, gathering courage as he went along,			
<lb/>Bully Bill told the tale of the branding.</p>
            <p>P. D., finger tips of either hand precisely			
<lb/>touching, heard him through with ill-con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cealed impatience and finally snapped:</p>
            <p><q>And you adjudge a man a coward because			
<lb/>of a few words said while in a condition of			
<lb/>semi-hysteria and delirium. Pi-shshsh! Any			
<lb/>half-baked psychologist would tell you that</q></p>

            <p>a man is not responsible for his vague utter<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ances at such a time. The evidence you ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>duce, sir, is inconclusive, not to say prepos<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>terous, and damned piffling and trifling. By			
<lb/>Gad! sir, the réle of judge and jury does not			
<lb/>become you. You’re hired to take care of			
<lb/>my cows, not to blaggard my men. What’s			
<lb/>been this man’s work?</p>
            <p><q>General hand, sir</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Efficient?</q></p>
            <p><q>Ain’t no good at chores. He’s the bunk at			
<lb/>fencing. Ain’t a bit o’ help with implements;			
<lb/>no account in the brush; ain’t worth his salt			
<lb/>in the hay field; but—</q> reluctantly the fore<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man finished, <q>—he’s a damned good rider,			
<lb/>sir. Best at O Bar O, and he’s O. K. with			
<lb/>the doegies</q>.</p>
            <p><q>And you ask me to fire a first-class rider			
<lb/>at a time when the average "bo that comes			
<lb/>to a ranch barely knows the front from the			
<lb/>hind part of an animal?</q></p>
            <p><q>Dad</q>, interjected Hilda again, her cheeks			
<lb/>aflame. <q>Look here, you may as well know			
<lb/>the truth about this man. He was engaged</q></p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>in the first place as a joke—nothing but a joke,			
<lb/>and because Bully Bill was late at the haying			
<lb/>and said we’d have to cut out the races this			
<lb/>year, and things were dull, and he took him			
<lb/>on to liven things up, didn’t you, Bill?</p>
            <p>Bully Bill nodded.</p>
            <p><q>Well, we’ve had tenderfeet before at O			
<lb/>Bar O, and we've all taken a hand stringing			
<lb/>them, as you know, but this one was different.			
<lb/>IJ disliked him from the very first, and </q></p>
            <p><q>Ah, g’wan! You're stuck on him, and you			
<lb/>!?</q></p>
            <p>know it</p>
            <p>Sandy, who had returned as far as the door,			
<lb/>gave forth this disgusted taunt. Upon him			
<lb/>his sister whirled with somewhat of her			
<lb/>father’s fury.</p>
            <p><q>How dare you say thatr</q></p>
            <p><q>Cause it’s true, and I told him so, too</q>.</p>
            <p><q>You told Aim—him—that I—I—I </q></p>
            <p>Hilda was almost upon the verge of hys<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>terics. She was inarticulate with rage and			
<lb/>excitement. The thought of Sandy confiding			
<lb/>in Cheerio that she was <q>stuck</q> on him was			
<lb/>unendurable.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 187]</fw>
            <pb n="188"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p><q>Why so much excitement?</q> queried her			
<lb/>father. <q>Do you realize that the flood of			
<lb/>words you have unharnessed would have force			
<lb/>and power enough, if attached to machinery,			
<lb/>to run </q></p>
            <p><q>Do you think I’m going to stand for that			
<lb/>—that—mutt accusing me of caring for a—</q></p>
            <p>coward?</p>
            <p>At that moment, a gentle cough at the door			
<lb/>turned all eyes in its direction. Natty and			
<lb/>clean, in his grey English suit—the one he			
<lb/>had worn that first day he had come to O Bar			
<lb/>O—Cheerio was standing in the room looking			
<lb/>about him pleasantly at the circle of expres<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sive faces. No sooner had the girl’s angry			
<lb/>glance crossed his own friendly one, than out			
<lb/>popped the despised word:</p>
            <p><q>Cheerio!</q> said Cheerio.</p>
            <p>His glance rested deeply upon Hilda for a			
<lb/>moment, and then quietly withdrew. Sandy,			
<lb/>whose allegiance to his former hero and			
<lb/>oracle had been somewhat shattered by the			
<lb/>corral incidents, suddenly grinned at his friend			
<lb/>and favoured him with a knowing wink.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 188 J</fw>
            <pb n="189"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p><q>Aw, she’s hot under the collar just ’cause			
<lb/>I told her I told you about her being stuck			
<lb/>on you</q>.</p>
            <p><q>I—I—just fancy me stuck on him! Just			
<lb/>as if any one could be stuck on someone they			
<lb/>—they—despised and hated and </q></p>
            <p>The words were pouring out breathlessly</p>
            <p>from the almost sobbing Hilda. Cheerio re<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>garded her gravely and then looked away. At			
<lb/>sight of the upturned chess table, he whistled			
<lb/>softly, stepped forward and set it in place.			
<lb/>Stooping again, he picked up the scattered			
<lb/>chessmen and then, to the amazement of all			
<lb/>in that room, Cheerio calmly proceeded to			
<lb/>set the men precisely in place upon the board.			
<lb/>As he put the King, the Queen, the Bishop,			
<lb/>the Knight and the Castles into their respec<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tive places, a curious expression, one of amaze<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment not unmixed with joy, quivered over the			
<lb/>weatherbeaten face of old P. D. McPherson.			
<lb/>When the pawns were upon their squares, al-</p>
            <p>most mechanically the Chess Champion of			
<lb/>Western Canada pulled up his chair to the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 189 ]</fw>
            <pb n="190"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>table. Over his glasses he peered up at the			
<lb/>Englishman.</p>
            <p><q>You play chess, sir?</q></p>
            <p><q>A bit</q>.</p>
            <p>A speck of colour came out on either of the			
<lb/>old man’s high cheek bones.</p>
            <p><q>Very good, sir. We will have a game</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Awfully sorry, sir. Ud jolly well like a			
<lb/>game, b-b-but the fact is, ’m—er—what you			
<lb/>call in Canada—hiking</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Hiking—nothing</q>, muttered P. D., as he			
<lb/>set his own side into place. <q>I allow you the			
<lb/>Whites, sir. First move, if you please</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Awfully sorry, sir, b-but the fact is, I’m			
<lb/>d-d-d-discharged, you know. Mr. Bully Bill			
<lb/>here——</q></p>
            <p><q>Damn Bully Bill! I’m the boss of the			
<lb/>O Bar O! Your move, sir</q>.</p>
            <p>Cheerio blinked, hesitated, and then lifted			
<lb/>his pawn and set it two paces forward.</p>
            <p>Slowly, carefully, P. D. responded with a			
<lb/>black pawn in the same position.</p>
            <p>Cheerio made no second move. He was			
<lb/>leaning across the board, looking not at the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 190]</fw>
            <pb n="191"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>chessmen but straight into the face of his em<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ployer.</p>
            <p><q>Tell you what I'll do, governor</q> (he had			
<lb/>always referred to P. D. as <q>governor</q>) <q>Tl			
<lb/>play you for my job. What do you say? One			
<lb/>game a night till I’m beat. I'll work through			
<lb/>the day as usual, and play for my job at night.			
<lb/>There’s a sporting proposition. How about			
<lb/>it?</q></p>
            <p>A snort came from Sandy and a smile from			
<lb/>Hilda.</p>
            <p><q>The poor simp!</q> audibly chuckled the boy.			
<lb/>Hilda was laconic and to the point:</p>
            <p><q>Hm! You'll be hitting the trail in short			
<lb/>order</q>.</p>
            <p>P. D. merely looked over his glasses with			
<lb/>a jerk, nodded and grunted:</p>
            <p><q>Very good, sir, I accept your terms. Your			
<lb/>move!</q></p>
            <p>Cheerio’s Knight made its eccentric jump,			
<lb/>and after a long pause the ranchman’s Bishop			
<lb/>swept the board. Cheerio put forward an<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>other pawn, and down came P. D.’s Queen.			
<lb/>His opponent’s King was now menaced from</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[191]</fw>
            <pb n="192"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>two sides, on the one by P. D.’s Queen and			
<lb/>on the other by his Bishop. Cheerio’s ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pression was blank, as after a pause he neatly			
<lb/>picked up and put another pawn one pace			
<lb/>forward. P. D. was holding his lower lip			
<lb/>between forefinger and thumb, a characteris<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tic attitude when in concerned thought. There</p>
            <p>was deep silence in the room, and it was fifteen			
<lb/>minutes before the ranchman made his next			
<lb/>move; ten before the Englishman made his.</p>
            <p>Hilda’s breath was suspended, her cheeks			
<lb/>scarlet, her eyes wide with excitement, while			
<lb/>Sandy, his mouth agape, watched the moves			
<lb/>with unabated amazement.</p>
            <p>Bully Bill, meanwhile, discreetly departed.			
<lb/>Once Cheerio had taken his seat opposite the			
<lb/>old chess monomaniac his foreman realized			
<lb/>that <q>the jig was up</q>. He did not admit de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>feat to his men. That would have been a			
<lb/>reflection upon his own influence at O Bar O.			
<lb/>Bully Bill gave forth the information that			
<lb/>Cheerio had given a satisfactory explanation			
<lb/>of his action at the branding, and the <q>con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fession</q> which Holy Smoke had overheard</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 192 ]</fw>
            <pb n="193"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>must ’ve been <q>a sort of a mistake. Because			
<lb/>there ain’t nothing to it</q>, said Bully Bill,			
<lb/>chewing hard on his plug, and avoiding the</p>
            <p>amazed eye of the injured Ho.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in the living-room of O Bar O,			
<lb/>two more moves had been made and the chess<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>men faced each other in an intricate position			
<lb/>for the one side. With eyes bulging, Sandy			
<lb/>leaned forward, staring at the board, while			
<lb/>Hilda drew her chair close to her father’s.			
<lb/>Slowly there dawned upon the son and daugh<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ter of P. D. McPherson—no mean chess play<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ers, despite their aversion for the game—the			
<lb/>realization that a trap was being deliberately			
<lb/>forged to close in upon their father’s forces.			
<lb/>Hilda wanted to cry out, to warn her old Dad,			
<lb/>but a pronounced twitching of P. D.’s left eye			
<lb/>revealed the fact that he was sensitively cog<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nizant of his danger. Hilda’s hand crept un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>consciously to her throat, as if to still her			
<lb/>frightened breathing, as she gazed with in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>credulous eyes at the diabolical movements of			
<lb/>the man she now assured herself she bitterly			
<lb/>and positively detested and loathed.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 193 ]</fw>
            <pb n="194"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>There was a long silence. Another move			
<lb/>and a longer pause. P. D.’s trembling old			
<lb/>hand poised above a Knight. Pause. A pawn			
<lb/>slipped to the left of the Knight. The Knight			
<lb/>half raised—no place to go—sacrificed. Out			
<lb/>came the Queen. &lt;A pause. The English<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man’s Bishop swept clear across the board and			
<lb/>took up a cocky position directly in the path			
<lb/>of P. D.’s King. He moved to take the Bishop,			
<lb/>saw the Castle in line, retreated, and found			
<lb/>himself facing Cheerio’s Queen. Another			
<lb/>move, and the Knight had him. A very long			
<lb/>pause. A search for a place to go. P. D.’s			
<lb/>dulled eyes gazed through their specs at			
<lb/>Cheerio, and the latter murmured politely:</p>
            <p><q>Check to your king, sir. Game</q>.</p>
            <p>The dazed P. D. stared in stunned silence			
<lb/>at the board, forefinger and thumb pinching			
<lb/>his underlip.</p>
            <p><q>Holy Salmon!</q> burst from Sandy. A sob			
<lb/>of wrath came from the big chair where sat			
<lb/>the daughter of the former chess champion.</p>
            <p><q>Awfully sorry, governor</q>, said Cheerio,			
<lb/>gently.</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>P. D. reached across a shaking old hand.</p>
            <p><q>I congratulate you, sir</q>, said the defeated			
<lb/>one. <q>You play a damned good game</q>.</p>
            <p>For the first time in his chess life, P. D.
