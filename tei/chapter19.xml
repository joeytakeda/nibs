            <p><hi rendition="#smallcaps">AUTUMN</hi> came late to Alberta that year,			
<lb/>and in the month of November, the cattle			
<lb/>were still upon the range. The experienced			
<lb/>cowman in Alberta is never deceived by the			
<lb/>long sun-laden days of however warm an Au<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tumn. Well he knows that the climate of			
<lb/>Alberta is like unto a temperamental woman			
<lb/>whose tantrums may burst forth into fury even			
<lb/>while her smile lingers.</p>
            <p>It is no uncommon thing in Alberta for a			
<lb/>period of warm and balmy weather to be elec<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>trically broken by amazing storms and bliz<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>zards which spring into being out of a per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fectly clear blue sky. Sometimes they last but			
<lb/>a few hours; sometimes they rage for a week,			
<lb/>during which period the effect is devastating			
<lb/>to such of the cattlemen who have their stock			
<lb/>still upon the range. The cattle caught un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>awares in the Autumn blizzard upon the open			
<lb/>range will sometimes drift for miles before it</p>

            <p>and have been known to perish literally by the			
<lb/>hundreds when trapped in coulie and gulch or			
<lb/>driven for shelter against fence line, lie buried			
<lb/>body on body. Because, therefore, blizzards			
<lb/>are dangerous matters for the cattle to contend			
<lb/>with, it is the custom in Alberta to round up in			
<lb/>the month of October, and some outfits round			
<lb/>up as early as September.</p>
            <p>At O Bar O this year there was an atmo<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sphere of restlessness and uncertainty. The			
<lb/>riders were all at hand, awaiting word from			
<lb/>the chief to set forth upon the Fall round-up;			
<lb/>to bring in the cattle loose on the winter range			
<lb/>to the home fields, where they would find			
<lb/>ample protection under the long cattle sheds,			
<lb/>and be given proper care and attention over			
<lb/>the winter months.</p>
            <p>For more than a month streams of cattle			
<lb/>belonging to other outfits had been passing			
<lb/>daily along the Banff Highway, coming down			
<lb/>from the summer range on the Indian or			
<lb/>Forest Reserve, en route to their winter homes			
<lb/>on the ranches. This steadily moving army			
<lb/>kept the O Bar O outfit on tenter-hooks.</p>

            <p>Bully Bill, chewing, spitting, moving rest<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lessly about, eager to be off, kept his own coun<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sel so far as the murmuring crew were con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cerned; but a suggestive question however			
<lb/>humourously or pacifically couched anent the			
<lb/>matter of O Bar O round-up aroused his irri<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tation and profanity to a hair-splitting degree.			
<lb/>The harassed foreman was beside himself			
<lb/>with anxiety and uncertainty. The sight of			
<lb/>his men slouching about the corrals and the			
<lb/>yards aroused both his wrath and his grief.			
<lb/>He had worked his wits all through the month			
<lb/>of October to find sufficient work to keep his			
<lb/>men going, but the work created by the fore<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man was of a sort for which a rider feels only			
<lb/>contempt. November the fifth, and riders—			
<lb/>cowpunchers of the great O Bar O ranch haul<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing logs for fire wood or fence posts! Put<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tering with fencing, brush-cutting—Indians’			
<lb/>work, by Gad! Snugging up the bunkhouse			
<lb/>and barn with dirt and manure for the winter!			
<lb/>By Gravy! Those were jobs for tenderfeet			
<lb/>and Indians. Not for self-respecting riders.			
<lb/>No wonder the fellows were beginning to</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>growl among themselves and cast black looks			
<lb/>at the ranch house. Two of them had quit the			
<lb/>service of the old ranch, two first-class men,			
<lb/>at that, and Bully Bill noted them later upon			
<lb/>the Banff Highway, riding with a hated rival			
<lb/>outfit.</p>
            <p>The O Bar O prided itself on maintaining			
<lb/>a prize crew of men. They knew every inch			
<lb/>of the range which extended over a hundred			
<lb/>and fifty thousand acres into the foothills of			
<lb/>the Rocky Mountains. They knew the brands			
<lb/>of half the cattlemen in Alberta. They could			
<lb/>pick out O Bar O stock even when the brand			
<lb/>was overgrown. At this time of year, skilled			
<lb/>labour of this sort were in great demand and			
<lb/>could choose their own jobs and demand their			
<lb/>own price. If P. D. failed to find them regu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lar men’s jobs, his foreman knew that presently			
<lb/>they would give ear to the solicitations of rival			
<lb/>outfits.</p>
            <p><q>Whispering Jake</q>, owner of the Bar D			
<lb/>Ranch in the Jackass Valley, kept his eye			
<lb/><q>peeled</q> always for O Bar O hands. Himself			
<lb/>unable to keep his men for long, he was satis-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 224 ]</fw>
            <pb n="225"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>fied to engage men trained at O Bar O and			
<lb/>discharged for one cause or another. ‘Whis<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>per, as he was more popularly known—the			
<lb/>name having been given to him in derision, be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cause he talked always at the top of his im<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mense voice—had been over the last few			
<lb/>weeks, supposedly to look for a roan heifer,			
<lb/>which he declared had strayed on to O Bar O.			
<lb/>Bully Bill knew very well that the cowman			
<lb/>had come, in fact, to look the O Bar O men			
<lb/>over and to drop a hint of the amount of ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vance he was willing to pay over what the men			
<lb/>were getting from P. D. <q>Whisper</q> made a			
<lb/>point of going up $20 a month over O Bar O			
<lb/>wages; but he dropped his men as soon as the			
<lb/>rush season was over and left them high and			
<lb/>dry for the winter. On the other hand, P. D.			
<lb/>did not raise his men’s wages in the busy sea-</p>
            <p>sons, but kept them on all winter, regardless of			
<lb/>slack periods and the drop of price in cattle.			
<lb/>At Christmas, moreover, if the stock were in			
<lb/>healthy shape and the profit of the business			
<lb/>warranted it, O Bar O men received an annual			
<lb/>bonus.</p>

            <p>This year <q>Whisper</q> had learned, through			
<lb/>the medium of Holy Smoke, that during the			
<lb/>period when the hands of O Bar O were idling			
<lb/>about waiting for P. D. to give the order to			
<lb/>set out upon the round-up, considerable of the			
<lb/>men’s wages had disappeared in poker games			
<lb/>played in the bunkhouse, and also at times in			
<lb/>the newspaper man’s camp. The losers, need<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing immediate funds, wavered toward the			
<lb/>promises of the other cattlemen, and especially			
<lb/>toward <q>Whispering Jake</q>.</p>
            <p>Chafe and fret and rage internally as Bully			
<lb/>Bill might, no word came forth from the ranch			
<lb/>house, where for more than a month the Chess			
<lb/>Champion of Western Canada and the poten<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tial challenger of the world had been closeted			
<lb/>each night with Cheerio. When the third man			
<lb/>left the service of O Bar O, Bully Bill heark<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ened to the suggestion of his assistant and ac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>companied by him paid a visit to the ranch			
<lb/>house, where he requested Chum Lee to ask			
<lb/>Miss Hilda to come to the front door.</p>
            <p>Hilda, in the living-room, intently watching			
<lb/>every move upon the board, looked up sur-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 226 ]</fw>
            <pb n="227"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>prised at the whispered message of the China<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man. Glad to escape from what she clearly			
<lb/>perceived was practically the end of another			
<lb/>game, the girl joined the foreman and his as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sistant upon the verandah.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda</q> began Bully Bill, <q>Ho and			
<lb/>I are here to-night to ask you what’re we goin’			
<lb/>to do about the cattle? We can’t afford to			
<lb/>wait no longer</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda debated the matter, hand on chin.			
<lb/>She was looking off quite absently and sud<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>denly she said to Bully Bill:</p>
            <p><q>Took here, Bill, if Dad had only moved			
<lb/>his Knight instead of his Castle, he could			
<lb/>have checked his King from both ends of the			
<lb/>board and the jig would have been up. But			
<lb/>Dad’s losing his nerve. He’s been beat too			
<lb/>often lately. I can just see him fairly break<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing. It’s telling on him. He’s an old man, my			
<lb/>Dad is, and it’s terrible at his age to lose confi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>dence. So long as Dad knew he was the best			
<lb/>player in the West, he was just as cocky and			
<lb/>spunky as a two-year-old, but you ought to see			
<lb/>him now. Bunched up in his chair, his old</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 227 ]</fw>
            <pb n="228"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>eyes dim, and the eyebrows sticking out and			
<lb/>his lip bulged. You’d hardly know him. Oh!			
<lb/>if he had only moved his Knight! I could			
<lb/>just have slapped him when he lifted that			
<lb/>darned Castle. I tell you, Bill, Dad has			
<lb/>simply got to beat him. He’s got to win at			
<lb/>least one game. He’d never survive a perma<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nent defeat, and apart from Dad’s feelings,			
<lb/>neither would I!</p>
            <p><q>But, look-a-here, Miss Hilda, what’re we			
<lb/>all agoin’ to do till then? We can’t allow			
<lb/>them cattle to be out till end of November.			
<lb/>Why, them cattle </q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, the cattle! The cattle! You give me			
<lb/>a pain! Can’t you think of anything but cattle,			
<lb/>cattle, cattle? I guess there’s people in the			
<lb/>world as well as cattle, cattle!</q></p>
            <p><q>So there are, miss, but at this time of year			
<lb/>we got to think of the cattle first, or they’ll get			
<lb/>thinking with their own feet and first thing we</q></p>
            <p>know theyll wander off somewheres where</p>
            <p>you ain’t goin’ to see them no more. Just let</p>
            <p>’em get awandering up in them hills near</p>
            <p>Broken Nose Lake, and I betchu that'll be the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 228 ]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>last of em. Besides, I heered down in Coch<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rane that there’s a sight of rustlers prowlin’			
<lb/>around this year, and the Indians ain’t any too			
<lb/>scrupilous and when they’re hungry, they ain’t			
<lb/>depising no handy beef. Why, Jim Lame<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>Leg’s doin’ time now for as slick a trick as			
<lb/>ever I heerd of. Drive a cow over a canyon,			
<lb/>and then git the job of haulin’ her out, and			
<lb/>when she’s out she’s got her leg broke and she			
<lb/>dies on his hand, and the owner pays for the			
<lb/>haulin’ of the cow out with the dead carcass.			
<lb/>Lee caught ’im breakin’ a leg of one of the			
<lb/>Lazy L’s stock and the boss told him to go			
<lb/>ahead and shoot her and keep the carcass, till			
<lb/>someone put him wise, and he had the Mounty			
<lb/>down from the Reserve and Jim Lame-Leg’s			
<lb/>doin’ time now. If we don’t look out there'll			
<lb/>be others just as smart as Jim and when we			
<lb/>come to countin’ up stock, I betchu we'll be			
<lb/>out a dozen head and more.</p>
            <p><q>Well, it’s pretty bad, I know, but I won’t			
<lb/>have Dad bothered about cattle. He’s got			
<lb/>enough on his mind right now. Anyway, I			
<lb/>believe the cattle are all right. What's the</q></p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 229 ]</fw>
            <pb n="230"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>matter with the herders, anyway? They’re			
<lb/>still out, aren’t they?</p>
            <p><q>Herders! My foot! Excuse my cussing,			
<lb/>miss, but when you talk of herders,—my gosh!			
<lb/>Herders ain’t a bit of good when the cold			
<lb/>snap comes. They keep in their tents and			
<lb/>holler for the riders and that’s what the riders			
<lb/>is for</q>.</p>
            <p><q>But then, look at the weather this year.			
<lb/>The cattle’ll get along for a month yet, I do			
<lb/>believe. Last year we had soft weather clear			
<lb/>up till Christmas. You know that and lots of			
<lb/>cattle people were sorry they hadn’t taken ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>vantage of the weather and left the cattle on			
<lb/>the range. Anyway, they'll come trailing home			
<lb/>gradually themselves. Have all the gates			
<lb/>down</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Some’ll come home, sure enough, but we			
<lb/>got a lot of new stuff and they ain’t broke to			
<lb/>this range. We threw some of the best stock			
<lb/>you ever set eyes on over to the north of Loon			
<lb/>Lake. If a storm comes up——</q></p>
            <p>Holy Smoke, plaiting a long cowhide bull<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>but his ears were pricked up and his crafty			
<lb/>eyes scarcely left the girl’s face.</p>
            <p><q>I tell you what you'd better do</q>, suggested			
<lb/>Hilda, <q>get your men together and start on			
<lb/>off. Dad won’t mind, and it’s the only thing			
<lb/>to do</q>.</p>
            <p><q>He won’t mind! He threw a million fits			
<lb/>last year when I just gathered in the lighter			
<lb/>stuff before he said the word—stuff that was			
<lb/>right at the gate, at that. Orders is flat, noth<pc force="weak">-</pc>

<lb/>Almighty on the O Bar O—begging your par<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p><q>T’ll say sol</q> declared P. D.’s daughter with

<lb/>on the table before him</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Nothing doing. Tried the job last week.			
<lb/>He was out on this verandy and he was walkin’			
<lb/>up and down, with his hands behind him and			
<lb/>his head dropped, and I ses to myself, ‘Mebbe			
<lb/>he’s through. IT’Il tuck in a word edgeways

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Hilda was leaning forward, wide-eyed with			
<lb/>delighted interest. Dad’s utterances were al<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ways matters of the profoundest psychological			
<lb/>interest and pride to his admiring daughter.</p>
            <p>Bully Bill lowered his voice confidentially.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda, I ain’t got the nerve to repeat			
<lb/>to you the curious string of damns and cusses			
<lb/>that your father give me and </q></p>
            <p>Hilda laughed, a rippling girlish chuckle			
<lb/>of genuine pride and delight.</p>
            <p><q>Isn’t Dad a perfect peach when he starts			
<lb/>swearing? Don’t you love it? It sounds so—			
<lb/>so—healthy, somehow. Can’t he just rip out</q></p>
            <p>the dandiest string of swear words you ever			
<lb/>did hear? I'll bet there’s not another man in			
<lb/>the entire country can cuss as my Dad can.			
<lb/>Most of ’em run off just the ordinary common			
<lb/>old damns, but Dad—why Dad can—can—			
<lb/>literally coin cuss words. I’d rather hear my			
<lb/>Dad cuss than—than—hear a prima donna			
<lb/>sing. Why, do you know, the very first word			
<lb/>that either Sandy or I learned to speak was			
<lb/>‘damn’!</p>
            <p>Up tossed the young head. Hilda’s white</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>teeth shone as her fresh laughter rippled forth,			
<lb/>and at that musical sound, and the sight of the			
<lb/>beautiful, laughing young woman before him,			
<lb/>moved by an irresistible impulse, Holy Smoke,			
<lb/>who had been squatting at his work, jumped			
<lb/>restlessly to his feet. Hilda’s back was to the			
<lb/>door. The hall was dark behind her.</p>
            <p><q>Miss Hilda</q>, said Ho, ingratiatingly, <q>we			
<lb/>thought as how if you would ask your father</q></p>
            <p/>
            <p>and.</p>
            <p><q>TP? Not on your life. It’s all I can do to			
<lb/>induce him to eat, let alone talk of anything			
<lb/>else in the world except chess—Kings,			
<lb/>Queens, Knights, Bishops, Rooks, Pawns!			
<lb/>Gods and devils! Why did he make this

<lb/>and if he had done this and hadn’t done that			
<lb/>such and such a thing might have happened.			
<lb/>Why, Dad’s just plumb chess crazy!</q></p>
            <p><q>You said it</q>, grinned Ho delightedly,

            <p><q>What's that you say?</q></p>
            <p>Hilda’s voice had risen with excitement.			
<lb/>Someone came out of the living-room inside,			
<lb/>and paused half-way across the hall on his way			
<lb/>to the verandah.</p>
            <p><q>I said—</q> repeated Holy Smoke, feeling a			
<lb/>curious excitement and delight in the flaming

            <p>At the mention of Cheerio, the dark blood
