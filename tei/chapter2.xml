<lb/>the turf, and at his last turn-over, his head			
<lb/>came into contact with something hard. He			
<lb/>rubbed said head, and at the same time ob<pc force="weak">-</pc>	
<lb/>served that which had pained him. It was a			
<lb/>large, old-fashioned gold locket, studded with			
<lb/>rubies and diamonds.</p>
            <p><said who="#Sandy">Holy Salmon!</said> ejaculated the highly-		
<lb/>elated boy. In an instant he had seized the			
<lb/>bridle of his horse, and was on him. He went			
<lb/>up the hill on a run, and began calling out<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p><said who="#Sandy" toWhom="#Hilda">Hilda! I say, Hilda! Come on out!			
<lb/>Looka here what <emph>I</emph> found!</said></p>
            <p>A girl, skin bronzed by sun and wind, with			
<lb/>chocolate-coloured eyes and hair and a cer<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tain free grace of motion and poise, came on			
<lb/>to the wide verandah. Sandy had ridden his			
<lb/>horse clear to the railing, and now he ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>citedly held up the trinket in his hand, and</p>

            <p>then tossed it to Hilda, who caught it neatly			
<lb/>in her own. Turning it over, the girl ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>amined to find with admiration and curiosity,			
<lb/>and, with feminine intuition, she found the			
<lb/>spring and opened the locket. Within, the			
<lb/>lovely, pictured face of a woman in low-cut			
<lb/>evening dress, looked back from the frame.			
<lb/>On the opposite side, a lock of dead-gold hair			
<lb/>curled behind the glass.</p>
            <p>Sandy had leaped off his horse, and now			
<lb/>was excitedly grasping after the treasure.</p>

            <p>Hand shading his eyes, the stranger was			
<lb/>gazing across the wide-spreading panorama

            <p>There was a ring of men closing in about

<lb/>Hootmon had hurried them along from

<lb/>With a vast smile of benignant humour di<pc force="weak">-</pc>

            <p>With immense satisfaction and relish, the			
<lb/>newcomer was taking in all of the colour and

<lb/>himself was an object of derisive mirth to the

            <p>A skirt—pink—flirted around the side of

            <p>As he looked up at the beautiful, <term>saucy</term>			
<lb/>young creature before him, the Englishman			
<lb/>was seized with one of his worst spells of stut<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tering. The impediment in his speech was			
<lb/>slight, on ordinary occasions, but when unduly			
<lb/>moved, and at psychological moments, when			
<lb/>the tongue’s office was the most desired of ad<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>juncts, it generally failed him. Now:</p>

            <p>The girl, hands on hips, swayed back and

            <p>He had recovered his wits, and the use of			
<lb/>his tongue. His heels came together with a			
<lb/>curiously smart and military click, and his			
<lb/>blue eyes looked squarely into the impudent</p>

            <p>brown ones of the girl, laughing in his face.			
<lb/>With complete gravity, he replied:</p>

            <p>She tossed it across to him. It dropped on			
<lb/>the stones between them. He stooped to pick			
<lb/>it up, and anxiously examined it, before turn<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing to look back at the girl with a slightly stern

            <p>For some unaccountable reason, the girl’s			
<lb/>mood changed. She tossed her head, as the			
<lb/>colour flooded her face. Something wild and			
<lb/>free in that tossing suggested the motion of a			
<lb/>young thoroughbred colt.<note type="editorial">Here, another moment of Hilda's affiliation with animal; note that it's <q>thoroughbred</q> here.</note> Affecting great

            <p>He absently fished in his vest pocket, and			
<lb/>this action provoked a fresh gale of laughter			
<lb/>from the highly edified hands, in which the

            <p>the odour of the hot food, and the rich soup
