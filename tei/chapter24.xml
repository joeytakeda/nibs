            <p><hi rendition="#smallcaps">OF</hi> all the emotions, whether sublime or			
<lb/>ridiculous, that obsess the victim of that curi<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ous malady of the heart which we call Love,			
<lb/>none is more torturing or devastating in its			
<lb/>effect than that of jealousy with its train of			
<lb/>violent reactions.</p>
            <p>Love affected and afflicted Hilda and			
<lb/>Cheerio in different and yet in similar ways.</p>
            <p>Hilda, kneeling by her bed, her arms clasped			
<lb/>about her pillow, into which she had buried			
<lb/>her hot young face, gave herself up at first to			
<lb/>the sheer ecstasy and glow of those first exalt<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing, electrical thrills. All she comprehended			
<lb/>was that she was in love.</p>
            <p>Love! It was the most beautiful, the most			
<lb/>sacred, the most precious and the most terrible			
<lb/>thing in all the universe. That was what			
<lb/>Hilda thought. Gradually her thoughts be<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>gan to assemble themselves coherently. Sitting			
<lb/>upon the floor by her bed, Hilda brought back			
<lb/>to mind every incident, every word and look</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>that had passed between her and Cheerio that			
<lb/>she could recall since first he had come to			
<lb/>O Bar O.</p>
            <p>Who was this man she loved? What was			
<lb/>he doing at O Bar OP? Where had he come			
<lb/>from? Who were his people? She did not			
<lb/>even know his name. The very things that			
<lb/>had aroused the derision of the men, his de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cently-kept hands, the daily shave and bath,			
<lb/>his speech, his manner, his innate cleanliness			
<lb/>of thought and person—these bespoke the			
<lb/>gentleman, and Hilda McPherson had the			
<lb/>ranch girl’s contempt for a mere gentleman.			
<lb/>In the ranching country, a man was a man.			
<lb/>That was the best that could be said of him.</p>
            <p>With the thought of his past, came irre<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sistibly back to torment her the woman of the			
<lb/>locket—‘‘Nanna, for whom he had come to			
<lb/>Canada to make a home. She had never been			
<lb/>wholly absent from Hilda’s thought and un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>consciously now, as in the midst of her bliss			
<lb/>she came back vividly to mind, a little sob			
<lb/>escaped her. She tried to fight the encroach<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing thought of this woman’s claim.</p>

            <p><q>Suppose he had been in love with her, I’ve			
<lb/>cut her out! She is done for</q>.</p>
            <p>Thus Hilda, to the unresponsive wall fac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing her.</p>
            <p>Suppose, however, they were engaged.			
<lb/>That was a word that was followed by mar<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>triage. This thought sent Hilda to her feet,			
<lb/>stiff with a new alarm. The unquiet demon			
<lb/>of Jealousy had struck its fangs deep into the			
<lb/>girl’s innermost heart. She no sooner tried to			
<lb/>recall his face as he had looked at her in the			
<lb/>moonlight, the warm clasp of his hand, the			
<lb/>term of endearment that had slipped from his			
<lb/>lips, when the knife was twisted again within			
<lb/>her, and she saw the lovely face of the other			
<lb/>‘woman smiling at her from the gold locket,			
<lb/>with her fair hair enshrined on the opposite			
<lb/>side.</p>
            <p>The recollection was intolerable—unendur<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>able to one of Hilda’s tempestuous nature.			
<lb/>Suppose she should come to Alberta! Per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>haps she would not release him, even if he de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sired it! Suppose she should come even to			
<lb/>O Bar O. How would she—Hilda—bear to</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>meet her? Her wild imagination pictured			
<lb/>the arrival, and Hilda began to walk her floor.			
<lb/>Love was now a purgatory. What was she to			
<lb/>do? What was she to do? Hilda asked her<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>self this question over and over again, and			
<lb/>then when her pain became more than she			
<lb/>could bear, she turned desperately to her door.			
<lb/>At any cost, however humiliating to her pride,			
<lb/>she would learn the truth. She would go di<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rectly to him. She would ask him point-blank			
<lb/>whether from this time on it was to be her or			
<lb/>—Nanna!</p>
            <p>She had done without her dinner. She			
<lb/>could not have eaten had she been able to force			
<lb/>herself to the table. Her father had called			
<lb/>her, Sandy had pounded upon her door. It			
<lb/>mattered not. Hilda was deaf to all summons,			
<lb/>save those clamouring ones within her.</p>
            <p>As far as that goes, she was not the only one			
<lb/>at O Bar O who had gone supperless.</p>
            <p>Cheerio, after she had left him, remained			
<lb/>at the foot of the steps, just looking up at the			
<lb/>door through which the world for him seemed			
<lb/>to have vanished. How long he stood thus,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 277]</fw>
            <pb n="278"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>cannot be estimated by minutes or seconds.			
<lb/>Presently he sat down upon the steps, and soon			
<lb/>was lost in a blissful daze of abstraction.</p>
            <p>Above him spread the great map of the			
<lb/>skies, at this time of year especially beautiful,			
<lb/>star-spotted and slashed with the long rays of			
<lb/>Northern lights and the night rainbows. Still			
<lb/>and electric was the night. Keen and fresh			
<lb/>the air. The ranch sounds were like mellow			
<lb/>musical echoes. Even the clang of Chum			
<lb/>Lee’s cow-bell, calling all hands to the evening			
<lb/>meal, seemed part of the all-abiding charm of			
<lb/>that perfect night.</p>
            <p>The voices of the men en route from bunk<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>house to cook-car, the sharp bark of the dog			
<lb/>Viper, and the answering growls of the cattle			
<lb/>dogs, the coyote, still wailing wildly in the			
<lb/>hills.</p>
            <p>Lights were low in the bunkhouse and on			
<lb/>full in the cook-car. The absorbing job of			
<lb/><q>feeding</q> was now in process.</p>
            <p>All these things Cheerio noted vaguely,			
<lb/>with a gentle sort of delight and approval.			
<lb/>They were all part of the general beauty of</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>life on this remarkable ranch. He was con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>scious of a big, uplifting sense. He wanted to			
<lb/>shout across the world praise of this new land			
<lb/>that he had discovered; of the utter peace and			
<lb/>joy of ranching in the foothills of the Rocky			
<lb/>Mountains; of the girl of girls who was more			
<lb/>to him now than anything else on earth.</p>
            <p>A wide moon was now overhead, and the			
<lb/>country was bathed in a silvery light. The			
<lb/>skies were star-spotted, and alive with mystery			
<lb/>and beauty.</p>
            <p>Snatches of poetry sang in his head, and for			
<lb/>the first time since the days when he had			
<lb/>penned his boyish love lyrics to Sybil Chenno<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>weth, Cheerio indited new ones to Hilda, the			
<lb/>girl he now loved:</p>
            <p><q>Oh, Hilda, my darling, the sky is alive,			
<lb/>And all of the stars are above;			
<lb/>The moon in her gown of silvery sheen—			
<lb/>She knows of my love—my love</q>.</p>
            <p>It mattered not to the lover whether his			
<lb/>verses were of a high order from a critical</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 279 ]</fw>
            <pb n="280"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>point of view. They were heartfelt—an ex<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pression of what seemed surging up within			
<lb/>him. He needed a medium through which he			
<lb/>might speak to Hilda. On the back of an			
<lb/>envelope, he scratched:</p>
            <p><q>Hilda of the dark brown eyes			
<lb/>And lips so ripe and red</q>.</p>
            <p>Hilda, of the wilful ways,</p>
            <p>And small, proud, tossing head.</p>
            <p>And so it went. But, like Hilda, the first			
<lb/>incoherent rhapsody gave way presently to			
<lb/>soberer thoughts. He was inspired by a de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>sire to do something to prove himself worthy			
<lb/>of the girl he loved. He was overtaken with			
<lb/>an appalling realization of his shortcomings.			
<lb/>What had he to offer Hilda? What had he			
<lb/>done to deserve her? He was but one of			
<lb/>twenty or more paid <q>hands</q> on her father’s			
<lb/>ranch. He was penniless; nameless!</p>
            <p>She was no ordinary girl. That brown-eyed			
<lb/>girl, with her independent toss of head and			
<lb/>her free, frank nature, he knew had the ten-</p>

            <p>der heart of a mother. Cheerio had watched			
<lb/>many a time when she knew it not. He had			
<lb/>seen her with the baby colts, the calves, the			
<lb/>young live-stock of the ranch; the hidden			
<lb/>litter of kittens in the barn, whose existence			
<lb/>was so carefully hidden from her father. He			
<lb/>had watched Hilda caring for the sick little			
<lb/>Indian papoose, wrapping antiseptic salve			
<lb/>bandages on a little boy’s sore arm, and stoop<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing to kiss the brown face and pat the shoulder			
<lb/>of the little Indian mother. No wonder she			
<lb/>was adored by half the country-side. No			
<lb/>wonder the Indians called her <q>little mother</q>			
<lb/>and friend. She was as straightforward, hon<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>est, and clean as a whistle. She was fearless			
<lb/>and fine as a soldier. There was about her			
<lb/>slim, young grace a boyish air of courage.			
<lb/>Hilda! There never was another girl like his			
<lb/>in all the whole world.</p>
            <p>Now Cheerio felt humbled, unworthy.			
<lb/>Followed a boyish desire to give Hilda things.			
<lb/>He regretted his poverty, and suffered a sense			
<lb/>of resentment and irritation for the first time			
<lb/>at the thought of the power and pride of a</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 281 ]</fw>
            <pb n="282"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>great family name that should by rights be			
<lb/>his and Hilda’s. What had he to offer her?			
<lb/>Nothing—but the trifling trinket, a family			
<lb/>heirloom, in which long since he had replaced			
<lb/>the picture of the English girl with the one			
<lb/>Sandy had given him of Hilda. Automati<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cally his hand closed about the locket. It was			
<lb/>a fine old antique. Hilda would appreciate			
<lb/>it. He would show her her own and Nanna’s			
<lb/>face inside it. He pictured her shining eyes			
<lb/>as she would take the trinket from his hand.			
<lb/>Once she had told him she possessed not a			
<lb/>single piece of jewellery. P. D. had de<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nounced them as <q>baubles, suitable for sav<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ages only—relics of days of barbarism. The			
<lb/>modern woman who pierced her ears</q>, said			
<lb/>P. D. McPherson, <q>and hung silly stones			
<lb/>from them was little better than the half-naked			
<lb/>black women who hung jewels and rings from			
<lb/>their noses</q>.</p>
            <p>But Hilda did not share her father’s opin<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ion. She had spoken wistfully, longingly, en<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>viously. This was after reading a chapter</p>

            <p>concerning Anne of Austria’s diamonds and			
<lb/>D’Artagnan’s famous recovery of the same.</p>
            <p>Well, Hilda should have her first piece of			
<lb/>jewellery from his hands. The ancient Chels<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>more locket. It would take the place of the			
<lb/>ring between them. It would be the symbol			
<lb/>of their love.</p>
