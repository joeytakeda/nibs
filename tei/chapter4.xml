            <p><hi rendition="#smallcaps">AT</hi> this time, P. D. McPherson held the title			
<lb/>of Champion Chess Player of Western Can<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ada. He was, however, by no means proud or			
<lb/>satisfied with this honourable title to chess			
<lb/>fame.</p>
            <p>Western Canada! One could count on the			
<lb/>fingers of one hand the number of real players			
<lb/>in the whole of the west. P. D. had played			
<lb/>with them all. He considered it child’s play			
<lb/>to have beaten them. P. D. had issued a chal<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lenge not merely to the eastern holders of the			
<lb/>title, but across the line, where went his bid to			
<lb/>contest the world’s title with the Yankee			
<lb/>holders of the same.</p>
            <p>P. D. dreamed and brooded over the day			
<lb/>when he would win in an international tourna<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment that would include the chess players of			
<lb/>all the nations of the world. Meanwhile, it			
<lb/>behooved him to keep in practice, so that his</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 40 ]</fw>
            <pb n="41"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>skill and craft should abate by not a jot or a			
<lb/>tittle.</p>
            <p>He had taught his young son and daughter			
<lb/>this noble game. Though good players, they			
<lb/>had inherited neither their parent’s craft nor			
<lb/>passion for it. Indeed, they had reason to fear			
<lb/>and dislike chess as a veritable enemy. Many			
<lb/>a ranch or barn dance, many a gymkhanna,			
<lb/>rodeo; stampede and Indian race; many a trip			
<lb/>to Calgary or Banff had been wiped off			
<lb/>Hilda’s pleasure slate, as punishment for a			
<lb/>careless move or inattention when the ancient			
<lb/>game was in progress. Many a night the			
<lb/>bitter-hearted Sandy had departed early, sup<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>perless, to bed, because of a boyish trick of			
<lb/>wriggling while his father debated in long<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>drawn-out study and thought the desirability			
<lb/>of such and such a move.</p>
            <p>Hilda and Sandy loved their father; yet his			
<lb/>departure upon a scouting expedition on the			
<lb/>trail of a prospective chess player filled them			
<lb/>always with a sense of unholy elation and			
<lb/>ecstatic freedom.</p>
            <p>P. D.’s good or bad humour upon his return</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[41 ]</fw>
            <pb n="42"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>to the ranch depended entirely upon the suc<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>cess or failure of his quest. If success crowned			
<lb/>his pursuit, and his cravings were satisfied,			
<lb/>P. D. returned, beaming with good will upon			
<lb/>the world in general and the inhabitants of			
<lb/>O Bar O in particular. On the other hand,			
<lb/>should such excursions have proven fruitless,			
<lb/>the old monomaniac came back to his ranch in			
<lb/>uncertain and irascible humour. All hands			
<lb/>upon the place then found it expedient and			
<lb/>wise to give him a wide berth, while his un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>fortunate son and daughter were reduced to			
<lb/>desperate extremities to escape his especial no<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tice and wrath.</p>
            <p>It should not be inferred from the foregoing			
<lb/>that P. D. necessarily neglected his ranching			
<lb/>interests. Chess was a periodic malady with			
<lb/>him. The ranch was a permanent institution.			
<lb/>O Bar O was the show-place of the foothills			
<lb/>and a matter of pride to the country. The			
<lb/>smoothest of beef, grass-fed steers, topped the			
<lb/>market each year, when they went forth from			
<lb/>the ranch not merely to the local stockyards,			
<lb/>but to Kansas City, Montreal, St. Louis, and</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 42]</fw>
            <pb n="43"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>Chicago, in the latter place to compete with			
<lb/>success with the corn-feds of the U.S. A.</p>
            <p>At the fairs, over the country, O Bar O stock			
<lb/>carried a majority of the ribbons, and			
<lb/><q>Torchy</q>, a slim, black streak of lightning			
<lb/>and fire, brought undying fame to its owner			
<lb/>by going over the bar of the annual horse<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>show of Calgary, with Hilda upon his back,			
<lb/>the highest peak ever attained by a horse in			
<lb/>Canada.</p>
            <p>A berth at O Bar O was coveted by all the			
<lb/>riders and cowpunchers of the country. The			
<lb/>fame of the fine old ranch had crossed the line,			
<lb/>in fact, and had brought to the ranch some of			
<lb/>the best of the bronco busters and riders.			
<lb/>The outfit could not, in fact, be beaten. The			
<lb/>food was of the best; the bunkhouses modern			
<lb/>and clean; the work done in season and in a			
<lb/>rational number of hours per day; the wages			
<lb/>were fair; first-class stock to care for; a square			
<lb/>foreman, and a bully boss. What more could			
<lb/>a man wish upon a cattle ranch? Pride per<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>meated to every man-Jack upon the place.			
<lb/>Each sought to stand well in the eyes of P. D.,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 43 J</fw>
            <pb n="44"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>and his praise was a coveted thing, while his			
<lb/>anger was something to escape, and unlikely to			
<lb/>be forgotten.</p>
            <p>P. D.’s praise took the form of a resounding,			
<lb/>smashing clap upon the shoulder, a prized as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>signment, and a bonus at the end of the month.			
<lb/>His anger took the form of an ungodly and			
<lb/>most extraordinary string of blistering and			
<lb/>original curses, words being cut in half to slip			
<lb/>curses midway between as the torrent poured			
<lb/>from the wrathful P. D.</p>
            <p>It may be mentioned in passing that P. D.’s			
<lb/>son and his daughter had inherited and were			
<lb/>developing a quaint vocabulary of typical O			
<lb/>Bar O <q>cusses</q>, much to their father’s amaze<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ment and indignation. Indeed, the first time			
<lb/>P. D.’s attention was directed toward this			
<lb/>talent of his daughter—her voice was raised in			
<lb/>shrill damning speech toward a squawking			
<lb/>hen who desired to sit upon a nest of eggs			
<lb/>destined for the house—the old fellow stopped			
<lb/>midway in his strut across the barnyard, over<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>come with dismay and anger. Every <q>hand</q>			
<lb/>within sight and sound was bawled to the pres-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 44]</fw>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>ence of the irate parent, and upon them he			
<lb/>poured the vials of his wrath.</p>
            <p><q>Where in hot hell did my daughter learn			
<lb/>such language? You blocketty, blinketty,			
<lb/>gosh darned, sons of cooks and dish-washers			
<lb/>have got to cut out all this damned, cursed,			
<lb/>hellish language when my daughter’s around.			
<lb/>D’you hear me?</q></p>
            <p>And to the foreman!</p>
            <p><q>Orders to your men, sir, no more damned			
<lb/>cursing upon the place! Tl have you and			
<lb/>your men know that this is O Bar O and not a			
<lb/>G— D— swearing camp for a blasted lot of			
<lb/>bohunks</q>.</p>
            <p>This, then, was the outfit to which the seem<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ingly guileless Englishman had become at<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tached.</p>
            <p>P. D., his bushy eyebrows twitching over			
<lb/>bright old eyes, confirmed the judgment of the			
<lb/>foreman, that <q>a bite of entertainment won’t			
<lb/>come amiss at O Bar O</q> in the shape of the			
<lb/>English tenderfoot.</p>
            <p><q>Put him through the ropes, damn it. Get</q></p>
            <p>all the fun you want out of him. Work the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[45]</fw>
            <pb n="46"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>blasted hide off him. Make him sweat like			
<lb/>hell to earn his salt. Go as far as you like,			
<lb/>but—- and here P. D.’s bushy eyebrows drew			
<lb/>together in an ominous frown, <q>give the man a			
<lb/>damned square deal. This is O Bar O, and			
<lb/>we'll have no G—- D— reflections upon the			
<lb/>place</q>.</p>
            <p>So the Englishman was <q>put through the			
<lb/>ropes</q>. Despite his greenness and seeming in<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>nocence, it is possible that he was wider awake			
<lb/>than any of the men who were working their			
<lb/>wits to make his days and nights exciting and			
<lb/>uproarious. He played up to his part with			
<lb/>seeming ingenuousness and high good humour.			
<lb/>If the hands of O Bar O regarded him as a			
<lb/>clown, a mountebank, a greenhorn, he played			
<lb/>greener and funnier than they had bargained			
<lb/>for.</p>
            <p>He was given steers to milk. He was as<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>signed the job of <q>housemaid, nurse, chamber<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>maid, and waitress</q> to the house barn stock.			
<lb/>He fed the pigs, and he did the chores of cook<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>car and bunkhouse. . All the small and mean			
<lb/>jobs of the ranch were assigned to the new-</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[46]</fw>
            <pb n="47"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>comer. He was constantly despatched upon			
<lb/>foolish and piffling errands. For an indefinite			
<lb/>period, he was relegated to the woodpile of			
<lb/>the cook-house. This was a job that the aver<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>age cowman scorned. The cowpuncher and			
<lb/>ranch rider consider any work not concerned			
<lb/>with horse or cattle a reflection upon their			
<lb/>qualities as riders. Cheerio, however, ac<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>quired a genuine fondness for that woodpile.			
<lb/>He would chop away with undiminished cheer			
<lb/>and vigour, whistling as he worked, and at the			
<lb/>end of the day, he would sit on a log and			
<lb/>contentedly smoke his pipe, as he surveyed the			
<lb/>fruit of his labours with palpable pride and			
<lb/>even vanity.</p>
            <p><q>Boastin’ of how many logs he’d split.			
<lb/>Proud as a whole hen. Hell! you can’t feaze			
<lb/>a chap like that. He’d grin if you put’m to			
<lb/>breakin’ stones</q>.</p>
            <p>Thus Bully Bill to Holy Smoke, assistant			
<lb/>foreman at the O Bar O. <q>Ho</q> as he was			
<lb/>known for short, scowled at that reference to			
<lb/>breaking stones, for Ho knew what that meant</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[47]</fw>
            <pb n="48"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>in another country across the line. Out of the			
<lb/>side of his mouth he shot:</p>
            <p><q>Why don’t cha set ’im choppin’ real logs if			
<lb/>he’s stuck on the job. Stick ’im in the timber			
<lb/>and see if he’ll whistle over his job then</q>.</p>
            <p>So <q>into the timber</q> went Cheerio, with			
<lb/>strict orders to cut down ten fifty-feet tall trees			
<lb/>per day. He looked squarely into the face of			
<lb/>the assistant foreman, and said: ‘Righto,			
<lb/>and took the small hand axe handed him by			
<lb/>the solemn-faced Hootmon, whose tongue			
<lb/>was in his cheek, and who doubled over in			
<lb/>silent mirth as soon as Cheerio’s back was			
<lb/>turned. But neither Mootmon, nor Ho, nor			
<lb/>Bully Bill, nor, for that matter, old P. D. or			
<lb/>his son and daughter, laughed when at the end			
<lb/>of the day Cheerio returned with twelve trees			
<lb/>to his credit for the day’s work. It was, in			
<lb/>fact, a matter of considerable wonder and			
<lb/>speculation as to the method employed by the			
<lb/>Englishman to achieve those twelve immense			
<lb/>trees through the medium of that small hand			
<lb/>axe. Cheerio went on whistling, kept his own			
<lb/>counsel, and was starting off the next morning</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 48]</fw>
            <pb n="49"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>upon a similar errand when Bully Bill hark<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ened to another suggestion of his assistant, and			
<lb/>beckoned him to the corrals.</p>
            <p>There was a wary-eyed, ominously still,			
<lb/>maverick tied to a post, and him Cheerio was			
<lb/>ordered to mount. He said:</p>
            <p><q>Hello, old man—waiting for me, what?</q>			
<lb/>smiled at the boy holding his head, and swung			
<lb/>up into the saddle.</p>
            <p><q>Now</q>, said Bully Bill. <q>You lookut here.			
<lb/>You ride that bronc to hell and back again, and			
<lb/>break ’er cowboy if you have to break your			
<lb/>own head and hide and heart in doing it</q>.</p>
            <p>Then someone untied the halter rope, and			
<lb/>the race was on. He was tossed over and over			
<lb/>again clear over the head of the wild maver<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ick, and over and over again he remounted,			
<lb/>to be thrown again by the wildly kicking			
<lb/>bronco. Bruised and sore, with a cut lip and			
<lb/>black eye, he pursued, caught, and again			
<lb/>and again mounted, again and again was			
<lb/>thrown, to mount once again, and to stick			
<lb/>finally like glue to the horse’s back, while the			
<lb/>hooting, yelling ring of men surrounding the</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[49]</fw>
            <pb n="50"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>corrals—Hilda and Sandy upon the railings—			
<lb/>yelled themselves hoarse with derisive com<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ments and directions, and then went wild with			
<lb/>amazed delight, when, still upon the back of a			
<lb/>subdued and shivering young outlaw, Cheerio			
<lb/>swept around thecorrals. He arose in his stir<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>rups now, himself cheering lustily, and waving			
<lb/>that newly-acquired O Bar O hat like a boy.			
<lb/>Even Hilda begrudged him not the well<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>earned cheers, though she stifled back her own			
<lb/>with her hand upon her mouth, when she			
<lb/>found that he had observed her, and with eyes			
<lb/>kindling with pride, rode by.</p>
            <p>He was thumped upon the back, hailed as			
<lb/><q>a hellufafellow</q>, and enjoyed the pronounced			
<lb/>favour and patronage of Bully Bill himself,			
<lb/>who brought forth his grimy plug of chewing			
<lb/>tobacco, and offered a <q>chaw</q> of it to the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lishman. Cheerio bit into it with relish, nor			
<lb/>showed any sign of the nauseating effects of			
<lb/>a weed he preferred in his pipe rather than			
<lb/>his mouth,</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact, like most Englishmen			
<lb/>of his class, Cheerio was an excellent rider,</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[ 50]</fw>
            <pb n="51"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>though his riding had not been of the sort			
<lb/>peculiar to cowboydom. However, it did not			
<lb/>take him long to learn <q>the hang of the thing</q>.			
<lb/>He dropped his posting for the easy, cowboy			
<lb/>lope, and he discovered that, while one clung			
<lb/>with his knees when on an English saddle, such			
<lb/>an action had painful and exhausting results			
<lb/>with a stock saddle. There really was some<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>thing to Bully Bill’s simple formula:</p>
            <p><q>Hell! There ain’t nothin’ to this here			
<lb/>ridin’. All you got to do is throw your leg			
<lb/>over his back and—stick!</q></p>
            <p>His English training, however, stood him			
<lb/>in good stead. More than the foreman at O			
<lb/>Bar O noted and appreciated the fact that the			
<lb/>newcomer was as intimate with horses as if			
<lb/>they were human brethren.</p>
            <p>From this time on, his progress at the ranch			
<lb/>was swift, considering the daily handicaps the			
<lb/>men still continued to slip in his way. His			
<lb/>courage and grit won him at least the grudging			
<lb/>respect of the men, though, try as he might, to			
<lb/><q>pal</q> with the O Bar O <q>hands</q>, his overtures			
<lb/>were met with suspicion.</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[51]</fw>
            <pb n="52"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>There is about certain Englishmen, an at<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>mosphere of superiority that gives offence to			
<lb/>men of the newer lands. The <q>hands</q> of the			
<lb/>O Bar O realized instinctively that this man			
<lb/>belonged to another class and caste than their			
<lb/>own. No one in the outfit was in a mood to			
<lb/>be what he would have considered <q>patron<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ized</q>. It was all very well to have a whale of			
<lb/>a good time <q>guying</q>, <q>stringing</q>, and mak<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ing the tenderfoot hop. That was part of the			
<lb/>game, but when it came down to <q>pal-ing</q>			
<lb/>with a <q>guy</q>, who patronized the Ghost River			
<lb/>for a daily bath, wielded a matutinal razor,			
<lb/>and had regard for the cleanliness of his un<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>derwear as well as his overwear, that was a			
<lb/>different proposition. Undaunted by con<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>tinual rebuffs, however, Cheerio pertina<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ciously and doggedly continued to cultivate his			
<lb/><q>mates</q> of the bunkhouse, and at the end of			
<lb/>the second month he felt that he could call at			
<lb/>least four of the men his friends.</p>
            <p>Pink-eyed Jake vehemently and _ belliger<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ently proclaimed him a <q>damfinefellow</q>.			
<lb/>This was after Cheerio had knocked him out</p>
            <fw type="pageNum">[52]</fw>
            <pb n="53"/>
            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>in a bout, in private, after enduring public			
<lb/>bulldogging and browbeating. Hootmon			
<lb/>made no bones about expressing his conviction			
<lb/>that Cheerio was a <q>mon</q>! Neither he nor			
<lb/>Cheerio revealed the fact that the better part			
<lb/>of Cheerio’s first month’s wages was in the coat			
<lb/>pocket of the Scotchman, The latter had a			
<lb/>sick wife and a new baby in Calgary. Jim			
<lb/>Hull was unlikely to forget certain painful			
<lb/>nights, when all hands in the bunkhouse			
<lb/>snored in blissful indifference to his groans,			
<lb/>while Cheerio had arisen in his <q>pink pie<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>jammies</q> and rubbed <q>painkiller</q> on the			
<lb/>rheumatic left limb.</p>
            <p>The foreman by this time had discovered			
<lb/>that despite his stammering tongue and singu<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lar ways, this lean and slight young English<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>man could <q>stand the gaff</q> of twenty-four			
<lb/>hours at a stretch in the saddle, nor <q>batted an			
<lb/>eyelash</q> after a forty mile trip and back to			
<lb/>Broken Nose Lake, after a <q>bunch</q> of year<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>ling steers, without a moment off his horse, or			
<lb/>a speck of grub till late at night.</p>
            <p>His love of nature, his enthusiasm over sun-</p>

            <fw type="pageHeading">His Royal Nibs</fw>
            <p>sets and sunrises, the poetry he insisted upon			
<lb/>inditing to the moon and the star-spotted skies,			
<lb/>to the jagged outline of those misty mountains,			
<lb/>towering against the sun-favoured sky, the pen			
<lb/>pictures he drew of the men and the silhouette			
<lb/>shadows of ranch buildings and bush; the wild			
<lb/>flowers he carried into the bunkhouse and			
<lb/>cherished with water and sun; these and other			
<lb/><q>soft</q> actions, which had at first brought upon			
<lb/>him the amused contempt of the men, slowly			
<lb/>won at last their rough respect and approval.</p>
            <p>Came long evenings, when under the mellow			
<lb/>beams of the Alberta night sun, the wide<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>spreading hills and meadows seemed touched			
<lb/>by a golden spell, and a brooding silence			
<lb/>reigned on all sides, then the low murmur of			
<lb/>Cheerio, half humming, half reciting the songs			
<lb/>he had written of home and friends across the			
<lb/>sea, tightened something in the throats of the			
<lb/>toughest of the men and brought recollections			
<lb/>of their own far-off homes, so that with sus<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>pended pipes they strained forward the better			
<lb/>to catch each half-whispered word of the Eng<pc force="weak">-</pc>			
<lb/>lishmaa.</p>
